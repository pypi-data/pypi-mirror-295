# misfits

Misfits is a FITs table viewer for the terminal, written in python.
I want it to be snappy as hell and fully usable without touching the mouse.
It currently has some limitations (e.g. won't display array or VLA columns), but will work on them in case.
It leverages on astropy and pandas, and is built using [textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).
It works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Performances on Windows are worse.
Works best on modern terminals: windows new terminal, macOS iTerm2, linux is probably fine as it is.

### Installation

`pip install misfits`

Make sure to be installing into a fresh python 3.12 environment!

#### Installing with uv

`uv tool install misfits`

This is the **best method**. But you should install uv first, see their [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
The other methods will require you to activate the misfits environment to use it.
This won't, and you will be able to call misfits from terminal with one line: `misfits .`.

If you are unsure about `uv`: please don't, you should probably it. 
It is a great package manager from the [Astral](https://astral.sh/) people

#### Installing with anaconda

`conda env create -f conda-env.yml`

Will create a new environment and install `misfits` in it.

### Usage

From the terminal, type `misfits path_to_file.fits` or `misfits .`. 
The latter will open a prompt to choose a fits file from your current directory.
