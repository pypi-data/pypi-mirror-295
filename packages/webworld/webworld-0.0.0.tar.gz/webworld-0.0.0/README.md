# 🕸️🌍 `webworld`

*The Web as an RL environment*

This package contains constructs for converting the web into an RL environment
where pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned via RL (PPO and other
methods).

`webworld` provides an interface for defining RL environments as mini-games
on the web and exposes a few built-in games such as the **wikipedia navigation**
game.
