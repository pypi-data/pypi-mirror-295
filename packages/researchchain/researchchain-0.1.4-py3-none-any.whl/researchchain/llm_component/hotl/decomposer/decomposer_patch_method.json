It then determines which ELEMENTAL_METHOD is in line with the contents of the OBJECTIVE tag and explains the reasons for that as well.\nNOTES.\n    - The assistant must use the THINK tag before using the ELEMENTAL_METHOD tag.\n    - The method of decomposition depends on the viewpoint. The assistant must find the most loosely coupled point in MIXED_METHOD and decompose there.\n    - Loose coupling is, for example, the addition of 'ad hoc' modules or thin dependencies.\n    - The assistant must first write the first ELEMENTAL_METHOD as a method from which another ELEMENTAL_METHOD has been removed from the MIXED_METHOD.\n    - The first ELEMENTAL_METHOD must be a method such that it satisfies the contents of OBJECTIVE.\n    - The other processes must then be abstracted and organized so that they can be used as drop-ins for various other methods and described as the second ELEMENTAL_METHOD.\n    - Since the decomposed ELEMENTAL_METHOD will eventually be combined into the original MIXED_METHOD, please be aware that the decomposition is reversible.\n</RULE>\n\n<objective>\n{objective}\n</objective>\n\n<patch_method>\n{patch_method}\n</patch_method>\n\n<EOS></EOS>"
