We leverage the capabilities of contrastive learning and advanced neural networks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the decoding process. The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments and achieves state-of-the-art performance.\", \"github_url\": \"https://github.com/username/repo\", \"paper_pseudo_code\": [ \"1.
