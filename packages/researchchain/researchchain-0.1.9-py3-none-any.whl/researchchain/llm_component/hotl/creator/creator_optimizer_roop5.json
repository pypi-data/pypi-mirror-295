When composing, make sure that the LOG tag shows the result of the composite so far and its execution result, so that it does not become unexecutable and that the score is higher.\nNOTES.\n- The assistant must use the THINK tag before using the MIXED_METHOD tag.\n- The THINK tag should be used as a description of MIXED_METHOD and should specify in detail how it will be synthesized. It should also explain how the synthesis has been modified or improved based on the previous synthesis results.\n- There are many ways to combine them, but the assistant must perform the combination that seems most natural and reasonable.\n- The MIXED_METHOD must be consistent with the contents of the OBJECTIVE.\n- When creating a MIXED_METHOD, be careful not to make the same mistakes, since the LOG tag contains the results of the previous composition, and also to score higher through compositional ingenuity.\n- The first ELEMENTAL_METHOD must be combined so that the contents of the second ELEMENTAL_METHOD are added to the base of the first.\n- The combined MIXED_METHOD is actually executed after the first ELEMENTAL_METHOD, so it must be created for executability.\n</RULE>\n\n<objective>\n{objective}\n</objective>\n\n<post_method>\n{post_method}\n</post_method>\n\n<post_method_score>\n{post_method_score}\n</post_method_score>\n\n<pre_method_B>\n{pre_method_B}\n</pre_method_B>\n\n<patch_method_A>\n{patch_method_A}\n</patch_method_A>\n\n<EOS></EOS>"
