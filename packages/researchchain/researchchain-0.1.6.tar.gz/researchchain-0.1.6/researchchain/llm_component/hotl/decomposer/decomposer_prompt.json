The assistant must find the most loosely coupled point in MIXED_PROMPT and decompose there.\n    - Loose coupling is, for example, the addition of “ad hoc” modules or thin dependencies.\n    - It is important to understand the MIXED_PROMPT methodology, as it is described in ABSTRACT, which may provide some hints for decomposition.\n    - Assistants must first extract the “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT” and then write a base prompt that is MIXED_PROMPT minus the “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT”. The base prompt must then be written with the “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT” removed from the MIXED_PROMPT.\n    - For the “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT,” select a method with the following characteristics\n      \u3000 - A supplementary prompt that improves upon the base prompt, rather than the base prompt.\n\u3000\u3000\u3000- A prompt that is a feature of the ABSTRACT proposal.\n\u3000\u3000\u3000- Must be a distinctive prompt that, when combined with the base prompt and the “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT”, satisfies the OBJECTIVE.\n    - The “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT” must be described generically so that it can be used as a drop-in for various other prompts.\n    - Note that the decomposition is reversible, since the decomposed “first ELEMENTAL_PROMPT” will eventually be combined with the base prompt ELEMENTAL_PROMPT.\n\u3000- A given MIXED_PROMPT may only be decomposed into two ELEMENTAL_PROMPTs, and its contents may not be interpreted or altered.\n</RULE>\n\n<OBJECTIVE>\n{objective}\n</OBJECTIVE>\n\n<ABSTRACT>\n{paper_abstract}\n</ABSTRACT>\n\n<MIXED_PROMPT>\n{pre_method}\n</MIXED_PROMPT>\n\n<EOS></EOS>"
