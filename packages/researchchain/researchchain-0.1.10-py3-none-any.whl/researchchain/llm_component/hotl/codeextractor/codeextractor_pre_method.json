Also use the THINK tag with FOLDER_STRUCTURE and the contents of FILE to answer why you think it is important.\nNOTES.\n    - Assistants must use the THINK tag before using the PYTHON tag.\n    - The most important features vary from viewpoint to viewpoint. Assistants must find the most distinctive part of the FILE.\n    - A feature is a part of a general function that is ingeniously proposed and implemented.\n　　- The functions to be extracted must all be extracted as they are without deleting or modifying the functions in the classes in the FILE.\n　　- After this, we will work on decomposing the extracted methods, so keeping this in mind, the most characteristic classes must be found and answered as they are.\n</RULE>\n\n{folder_structure}\n\n{github_file}\n\n<EOS></EOS>"
