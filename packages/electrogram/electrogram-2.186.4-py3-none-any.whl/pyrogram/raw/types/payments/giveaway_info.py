class GiveawayInfo(TLObject):  # type: ignore
    """Contains info about an ongoing giveaway.

    Constructor of :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.base.payments.GiveawayInfo`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``187``
        - ID: ``4367DAA0``

    Parameters:
        start_date (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            When was the giveaway started

        participating (``bool``, *optional*):
            The current user is participating in the giveaway.

        preparing_results (``bool``, *optional*):

        joined_too_early_date (``int`` ``32-bit``, *optional*):
            The current user can't participate in the giveaway, because they were already a member of the channel when the giveaway started, and the only_new_subscribers was set when starting the giveaway.

        admin_disallowed_chat_id (``int`` ``64-bit``, *optional*):
            If set, the current user can't participate in the giveaway, because they are an administrator in one of the channels (ID specified in this flag) that created the giveaway.

        disallowed_country (``str``, *optional*):
            If set, the current user can't participate in this giveaway, because their phone number is from the specified disallowed country (specified as a two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code).
