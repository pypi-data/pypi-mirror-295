# Project
This is my simple python project, which does some simple stuff:
    - Logging
    - Sending data
    - Pinging
    - Getting data (passwords, ...)
    - Displaying notifications
    - Modifying strings
    - Checking connections
    - ...

    
## Functions
Following funcitons are included:
    - {"\n   - ".join(sorted(i.replace("_", " ").capitalize() for i in data["all"]))}


## Settings
You can manage some things in the settings file of the project,
which is directly in the parent folder of it.


## Conclusion
This is a simple package, that performs various tasks,
for that I am too lazy to do them. If you use this package
and do some silly stuff with it, I am not responsible for that!

However, this project is very simple, but effective.
