    The zuul_return Ansible plugin will now validate the schema of the
    data supplied to it; particularly the data for warnings and
    artifacts.  Previously the behavior on incorrectly structured data
    was undefined and ranged from being silently ignorred to causing
    exceptions in pipeline processing.  Data format errors will now be
    detected while the job is running and will cause Ansible errors
    and (if not ignored) job failures.
