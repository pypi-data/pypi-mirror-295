    Several job attributes may now have their inheritance behavior
    changed through "override control".  This introduces two new YAML
    tags, ``!override`` and ``!inherit`` which may be used to
    explicitly specify whether certain job attributes should inherit
    values from parent jobs or override them.

    See the general job documentation at :ref:`job` and also
    documentation for the following individual attributes:

      * :attr:`job.dependencies`
      * :attr:`job.extra-vars`
      * :attr:`job.failure-output`
      * :attr:`job.files`
      * :attr:`job.group-vars`
      * :attr:`job.host-vars`
      * :attr:`job.irrelevant-files`
      * :attr:`job.provides`
      * :attr:`job.required-projects`
      * :attr:`job.requires`
      * :attr:`job.tags`
      * :attr:`job.vars`
