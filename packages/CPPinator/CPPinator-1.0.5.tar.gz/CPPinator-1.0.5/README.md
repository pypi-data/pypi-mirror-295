# CPPinator

CPPinator is a Python automation script designed for compiling and running multiple C++ files in a specified directory. It simplifies the process of handling multiple C++ programs and provides a clear and organized output for each program's execution along with the execution time for each program.

## CPPinator on PyPI

## How it works

1. The script allows you to specify a directory path where your C++ source code files are located.

2. It changes the current working directory to the specified path.

3. CPPinator lists all the C++ source code files with the `.cpp` extension in the directory.

4. For each `.cpp` file found, it compiles the code using `g++` and runs the resulting executable.

5. The script captures and displays the output and any errors produced by each program.

6. Upon successful execution of all C++ files, it provides a summary message.

7. Finally, the compiled executable file (`a.exe`) is deleted to keep your directory clean.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.

2. Install the `CPPinator` package from PyPI using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install CPPinator
   ```

   OR

   Clone or download the `CPPinator.py` script to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hardvan/CPPinator
   cd CPPinator
   pip install .
   ```

3. Call the `compile_and_run_cpp_files` function from the `CPPinator` package with the directory path as an argument.

   ```python
   from CPPinator import compile_and_run_cpp_files

   compile_and_run_cpp_files("path/to/your/directory")
   ```

   View the `run.py` file for an example of how to use the `CPPinator` package.

## Example Output

Here's an example of the script's output when run with a list of C++ files in the `Basic Problems` directory.
