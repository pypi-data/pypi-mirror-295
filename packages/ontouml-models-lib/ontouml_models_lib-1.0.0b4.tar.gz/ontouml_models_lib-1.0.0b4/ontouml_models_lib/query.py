"""
The `query` module provides the `Query` class, designed to handle the loading, representation, and hashing of SPARQL \
queries for execution within the OntoUML/UFO catalog.

This module ensures that SPARQL queries are consistently managed,
enabling reliable query execution across RDF graphs representing ontology models.

Overview
--------
The `Query` class encapsulates SPARQL queries, providing methods to load queries from files, compute persistent hashes
to ensure the uniqueness and reusability of query results, and facilitate query execution across RDF graphs. This class
is crucial for managing the integrity and consistency of queries used within the catalog.

Usage
-----
Example 1: Loading a Query from a File

    >>> from ontouml_models_lib import Query
    >>> query = Query('/path/to/query.sparql')
    >>> print(query.query_content)
    # Output: "SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }"

Example 2: Computing the Hash of a Query

    >>> from ontouml_models_lib import Query
    >>> query = Query('/path/to/query.sparql')
    >>> print(query.hash)
    # Output: 12345678901234567890 (example hash value)

Dependencies
------------
- **hashlib**: For computing hashes of the SPARQL queries.
- **pathlib**: For handling file paths in a platform-independent manner.

    Represents a SPARQL query for execution within the OntoUML/UFO catalog.

    The `Query` class encapsulates a SPARQL query, providing methods for loading the query from a file, computing a
    persistent hash for the query content, and managing multiple queries through batch loading. This class ensures that
    queries are handled consistently, facilitating their reuse and reliable execution across RDF graphs representing
    ontology models.
