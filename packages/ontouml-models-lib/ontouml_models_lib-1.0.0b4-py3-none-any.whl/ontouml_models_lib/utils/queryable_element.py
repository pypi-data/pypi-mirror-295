"""
The `queryable_element` module provides the `QueryableElement` class, a base class designed to represent elements \
within the OntoUML/UFO catalog that can be queried using SPARQL.

This module facilitates the execution of SPARQL queries on RDF graphs, manages query results,
and ensures consistent hashing of both queries and graph data.

Overview
--------
The `QueryableElement` class serves as a foundational class for elements that interact with RDF graphs in the
OntoUML/UFO catalog. It provides methods for executing SPARQL queries on these graphs, computing and checking hashes
to prevent redundant query executions, and managing the storage of query results. This class is crucial for ensuring
the integrity, consistency, and reusability of queries within the catalog.

Dependencies
------------
- **rdflib**: For RDF graph operations and SPARQL query execution.
- **hashlib**: For computing hashes of RDF graphs and SPARQL queries.
- **pathlib**: For handling file paths in a platform-independent manner.
- **csv**: For managing the storage of query results in CSV format.
- **loguru**: For logging operations and debugging information.
