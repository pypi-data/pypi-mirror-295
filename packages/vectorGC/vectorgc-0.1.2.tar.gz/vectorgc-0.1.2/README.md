# Vector-GC - Modeling Dipolar Molecules with PCP-SAFT

[![repository](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vectorGC)](https://pypi.org/project/vectorGC)

`Vector-GC` is a group-contribution method for PCP-SAFT yielding parameters for non-polar and dipolar substances based on their molecular structure, e.g. given as SMILES. The method considers the dipolar term on a physical basis, thus improving predictions for dipolar substances and distinguishing cis- and trans-isomers. 

The method and the corresponding regression framework is published as pypi package and can be installed via pip as `vectorGC`. The regression framework utilizes rapid phase calculations and automatic differentiation through [FeOs-Torch](https://github.com/feos-org/feos-torch). The framework can be used to regress additional substance classes for the `Vector-GC` method or to develop novel group-contribution methods for PCP-SAFT (by implementing new sum rules).

## Using the `Vector-GC` Method

```python
from vectorGC import vectorGC

# get PCP-SAFT parameters from a SMILES
m, sigma, epsilon, mu = vectorGC.from_smiles("CCCCBr")
```

Currently, the `Vector-GC` method is parametrized for alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated substances, and halogenated substances. The parametrized groups and bonds are presented in our [publication](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c04867). 

## Using the Regression Framework

```python
import pandas as pd
import vectorGC.regression_framework.models as models
from vectorGC.regression_framework.solver import scipy_solver

# Use scipy solver without printing progress
solver = scipy_solver(show_progress=False)

# Load data required for the model fit
with open("path_to_group_info.json", "r") as f:
        group_info = json.load(f)
chem_id = pd.read_json("path_to_chemid.json").set_index("mol_id")
phys_data = pd.read_json("path_to_physdata.json").set_index("mol_id")

# Initialize vectorGC model to be fitted; use square root as normalization between properties
vecGC = models.vectorGC(chem_id, group_info, phys_data=phys_data, normalize="sqrt")

# Fit vectorGC model and generate results dictionaries
solver.fit(vecGC)
vecGC.get_fit_results()

# Perform leave-one-out cross-validation and generate results dictionaries (Attention: This can take up a lot of time & resources!)
solver.loocv(vecGC)
vecGC.get_loocv_results()

# Save the model in a pickle file
vecGC.save(path2outdir,filename)
```

### Implementing new sum rules
See [example_implement_Sauer2014_sumrules.ipynb](./examples/example_implement_Sauer2014_sumrules.ipynb) for an example how to use the `pcsaftGC` model class to define other sum rules. Here, we show implementing the sum rules for $\mu$, $\varepsilon^{A_iB_i}$, and $\kappa^{A_iB_i}$ defined by [Sauer *et al.*, 2014](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ie502203w). Re-implementing sum rules for $m$, $\sigma$, and $\varepsilon$ works equivalently by overloading the function `sum_rules_pcpsaft`, see [models source code](./vectorGC/regression_framework/models.py).

### Running regression & loading model
Examples for running the regression and loading models can be found in the examples folder. The script [run_model_regression.py](./run_model_regression.py) additionally yields an executable script that can be run as a background job.
