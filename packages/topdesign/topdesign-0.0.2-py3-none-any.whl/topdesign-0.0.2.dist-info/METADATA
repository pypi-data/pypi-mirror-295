# TopDesign

TopDesign is a general tool chain integration platform for multidisciplinary 
analysis and optimization, developed in DTU Wind as an open source tool.

The concept of the platform and the usage example on wind farm design can be 
found in:

platform for multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization in wind energy." In 
*Journal of Physics: Conference Series*, vol. 2767, no. 8, p. 082014. IOP 
Publishing, 2024.  [[link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2767/8/082014/meta)]

Source code of the platform is hosted in DTU Wind's GitLab site: 
> https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/topdesign/topdesign

Development of this platform has been partially supported by the [MERIDIONAL](
https://meridional.eu/) project, which receives funding from the European
Union’s Horizon Europe Programme under the grant agreement No. 101084216.

## Installation

You can install the TopDesign package using the following command:

>```
> pip install topdesign
>```

## Usage
The standard topdesign platform relies only on numpy and matplotlib. To run the
example on wind farm design, you need to have py_wake and floris (==3.5) 
installed.
