# Project description 

This Python package is designed to classify fish species, distinguishing between Bream and Smelt.
We use the KNN algorithm to implement this prediction system

# what is special about

1. This preidict system start with empty dataframe
2. This machine learning rate will increase as much as the data you put in
3. This machine will show you the ratio of correct answers to incorrect answers.Therefore, you can gauge the machine's level of growth from the accuracy rate.
5. This machine will show you the location of your data which you typed
