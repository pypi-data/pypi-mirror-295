# OGDUtils

This project contains several utilities developed to ease the process of working with data from the OpenGameData core.
There are a set of `general` utilities, which include importing of files into a standard pandas environment, and some basic organization of large datasets.
In addition, some games have specific utility packages, typically developed as part of existing analysis projects.
These projects are typically made available in the `opengamedata-samples` repository.

**Warning:** Outside the import utilities, this package has very little active support.
We make no guarantees anything else in the package works or is of practical use;
most of the utilities included here are just to increase the odds of success for anyone trying to work with older analysis files from `opengamedata-samples`.
