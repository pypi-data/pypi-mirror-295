The PDF Generator plugin automatically exports articles and pages as PDF files as part of the site generation process.
PDFs are saved to: `output/pdf/`

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-pdf

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `pdf` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

To customize the PDF output, you can use the following settings in your Pelican configuration file:

	PDF_STYLE = ""
	PDF_STYLE_PATH = ""

`PDF_STYLE_PATH` defines a new path where *rst2pdf* will look for style sheets, while `PDF_STYLE` specifies the style you want to use.
For a description of the available styles, please read the [rst2pdf documentation](https://rst2pdf.org/static/manual.html#styles).
