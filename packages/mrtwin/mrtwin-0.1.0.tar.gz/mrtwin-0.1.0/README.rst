MRTwin
======

MRTwin is a collection of virtual objects for numerical MR experiments.

Features
--------

- **Virtual Phantoms:** A collection of sparse (fuzzy and crisp) and dense phantoms for quantitative MRI based on different anatomical models (Shepp-Logan, Brainweb database, Open Science CBS Neuroimaging Repository database) and different tissue representations (single pool, two- and three-pools).
- **Field Maps:** Routines for generation of realistic field maps, including B0 (based on input phantom susceptibility), B1 (including multiple RF modes) and coil sensitivities.
- **Motion patterns:** Markov chain generated rigid motion patterns (both for 2D and 3D imaging) to simulate the effect of motion on MR image quality.
- **Gradient System Response:** Generate Gaussian-shaped gradient response function with linear phase components to simulate k-space trajectory shift and deformation due to non-ideal gradient systems.

Installation
------------

MRTwin can be installed via pip as:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mrtwin

Basic Usage
-----------

Using MRTwin, we can quickly create a Shepp-Logan phantom,
the corresponding static field inhomogeneity map and a set 
of coil sensitivity maps as follows

.. code-block:: python

    import mrtwin

    # 2D Shepp-Logan phantom
    phantom = mrtwin.shepplogan_phantom(ndim=2, shape=256).as_numeric()

    # B0 map
    b0_map = mrtwin.b0field(phantom.Chi)

    # Coil sensitivity maps
    smaps = mrtwin.sensmap(shape=(8, 256, 256))

This allow us to quickly simulate, e.g., a fully-sampled multi-coil Cartesian GRE experiment
as:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np 

    TE = 10.0 # ms
    rate_map = phantom.T2s + 1j * 2 * np.pi * b0_map
    gre = smaps * phantom.M0 * np.exp(-rate_map * TE)

This can be coupled with other libraries (e.g., `MRI-NUFFT <https://github.com/mind-inria/mri-nufft>`_)
to simulate more complex MR sequences (e.g., Non-Cartesian and sub-Nyquist imaging).
