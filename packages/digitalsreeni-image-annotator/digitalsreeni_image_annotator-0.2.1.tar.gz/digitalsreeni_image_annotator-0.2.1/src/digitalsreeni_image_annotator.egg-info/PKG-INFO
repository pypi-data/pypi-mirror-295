## Features

- Handling of multi-dimensional images (TIFF stacks and CZI files)
- Load and annotate images with polygons and rectangles
- Save annotations in COCO-compatible JSON format
- Edit existing annotations
- Ability to load and continue previous annotation work
- Zoom and pan functionality for detailed annotations
- Support for multiple classes with customizable colors
- Import and export annotations
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls and dark mode

## Installation

You can install the DigitalSreeni Image Annotator directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install digitalsreeni-image-annotator
```

### Important: PyQt5 Requirement

This application requires PyQt5 version 5.15.7 or higher. If you encounter any issues related to PyQt5, you may need to install or upgrade it separately:

```bash
pip install PyQt5>=5.15.7
```

If you're using an older version of PyQt5, please upgrade to ensure compatibility:

```bash
pip install --upgrade PyQt5>=5.15.7
```

On some systems, especially Linux, you might need to install additional system packages. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

Note that the system package manager might not always provide the latest version. In such cases, using pip as shown above is recommended.

For other operating systems or if you encounter any issues, please refer to the [PyQt5 documentation](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html).

## Usage

1. Run the DigitalSreeni Image Annotator application:
   ```bash
   digitalsreeni-image-annotator
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python -m digitalsreeni_image_annotator.main
   ```

2. Using the application:
   - Click "Open New Image Set" to load a new set of images from your computer.
   - Use "Add More Images" to append images to the current set.
   - Add classes using the "Add Class" button.
   - Select a class and use the Polygon or Rectangle tool to create annotations.
   - Edit existing annotations by double-clicking on them.
   - Save your annotations using the "Save Annotations" button.
   - Use "Import Saved Annotations" to load previously created annotations.
   - Access the help documentation by clicking the "Help" button.

3. Keyboard shortcuts:
   - Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in/out
   - Hold Ctrl and drag to pan the image
   - Press 'Esc' to cancel the current annotation
   - Press 'Enter' to finish the current polygon annotation
