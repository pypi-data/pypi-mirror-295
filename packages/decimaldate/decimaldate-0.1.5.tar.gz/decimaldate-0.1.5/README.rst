================
  Introduction
================

The source for this ``decimaldate`` project is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/TorbenJakobsen/decimaldate>`_.

.. note::

   This project and the development of the module ``datetime`` is documented here, in *this* ``README.rst`` file.

   The Python module itself, and its use, is documented in the ``docs/source`` as reStructuredText to be processed with Sphinx_
   and made available on `readthedocs <https://decimaldate.readthedocs.io/>`_.

=========================
  Setup for Development
=========================

Use a virtual environment
-------------------------

It is optional, but *highly* recommended to create and use a virtual environment.
This documentation will assume the use of a virtual environment and ``venv``.

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv

.. note::
   
   You can use other virtualization tools as you prefer.

Activate the virtual environment (remember the ``.``).

.. code:: bash

   . venv/bin/activate

.. note::

   This will activate for macOS and Linux.
   For Windows CMD or PowerShell run the activation scripts instead.

Install requirements
--------------------

Install requirements and their dependencies for development (which are not deployment dependencies).

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements/development.txt

Build and Test
--------------

Build (where the ``pyproject.toml`` file is located):

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m build

Install updated project with editing (remember the :code:`.`):

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --upgrade -e .

Test:

.. code:: bash

   pytest

Coverage:

.. code:: bash

   coverage run -m pytest tests

Make coverage report:

.. code:: bash

   coverage report -m

Make coverage report as html:

.. code:: bash

   coverage html

To see the html report, open ``htmlcov\index.html`` in a browser and/or light-weight http server.

Comments
--------

.. note::
   
   These commands are available as ``make`` targets in the included ``Makefile``

=================
  Documentation
=================

To build the documentation go to 
the ``docs`` directory and work with 
the reStructuredText (``.rst``) files and Sphinx_.

Use the ``make`` command to see options for documentation build using Sphinx_.
