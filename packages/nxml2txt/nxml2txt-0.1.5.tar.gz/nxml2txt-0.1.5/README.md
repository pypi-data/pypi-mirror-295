nxml2txt
========

NLM .nxml to text format conversion with added features for building agent-based systems with JATS-formatted files. 

This project was originally developed by Sampo Pyysalo as part of the UK's National Center for Text Mining (NaCTeM). The core functionality of the library renders the XML of a full text paper formatted under the JATS standard as a basic text with standoff annotations that provides access to the document structure and formatting labels. 

We are repurposing that original functionality to provide access to the internal structure of the document with section headings, citation sentences, and figure references in a flexible open source compute environment.
