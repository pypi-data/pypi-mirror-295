## Typing stubs for python-http-client

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`python-http-client`](https://github.com/sendgrid/python-http-client) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`python-http-client`.

This version of `types-python-http-client` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `python-http-client==3.3.7`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/python-http-client. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
