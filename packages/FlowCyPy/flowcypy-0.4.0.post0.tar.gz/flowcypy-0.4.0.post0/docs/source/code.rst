Code Documentation
==================

This document provides the API documentation for the Flow Cytometer simulation code, which models
the flow of particles through a flow cytometer and generates particle arrival times based on a
Poisson process. The classes and functions documented here are automatically generated from the
codebase using Sphinx `autoclass` directives.

Classes and Methods
===================

Below are the primary classes and methods used in the flow cytometer simulation.
