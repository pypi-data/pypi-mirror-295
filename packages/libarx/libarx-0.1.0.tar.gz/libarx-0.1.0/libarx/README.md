What is arx
===========

Arx is a file archive format based on the
[jubako container format](https://github.com/jubako/jubako).

It allow you to create, read, extract file archive (as zip or tar does).

Arx (and Jubako) is in active development.
While it works pretty well, I do not recommand to use it to do backups.
However, you can use it to transfer data or explore archives.

Try arx
=======

This package is the library use by [arx](https://crates.io/crates/arx), [tar2arx](https://crates.io/crates/tar2arx)
and [zip2arx](https://crates.io/crates/zip2arx) to create and read arx archive.
