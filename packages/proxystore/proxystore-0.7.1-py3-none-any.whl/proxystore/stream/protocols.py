"""Protocols used by the stream interfaces.

## Publisher/Subscriber

The [`Publisher`][proxystore.stream.protocols.Publisher] and
[`Subscriber`][proxystore.stream.protocols.Subscriber] are
[`Protocols`][typing.Protocol] which define the publisher and subscriber
interfaces to a pub/sub-like messaging system.

In general, these protocols do not enforce any other implementation details
besides the interface. For example, implementations could choose to support
any producer-to-consumer configurations (e.g., 1:1, 1:N, N:N).
A set of shims implementing these protocols for third-party message brokers
are provided in [`proxystore.stream.shims`][proxystore.stream.shims].

## Plugins

Additional protocols, such as the
[`Filter`][proxystore.stream.protocols.Filter], are plugins used by the
[`StreamProducer`][proxystore.stream.interface.StreamProducer] and/or
[`StreamConsumer`][proxystore.stream.interface.StreamConsumer] that alter
their behavior.
