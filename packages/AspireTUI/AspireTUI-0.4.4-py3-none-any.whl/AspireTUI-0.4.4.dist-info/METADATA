Brief
-----
ASPIRE is a Python 3.11+ module that offers an easy to use line-based text user interface framework.

It aims to make the console output more appealing to end users and provide developers an easy to use framework for 'everyday tasks' and to put their output left, center and right oriented with some 'dividers' (header, title) using a theme for presentation.


Target Audience
---------------
For developers aiming to enhance the user experience with the console.

![HelloWorld](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/help/1.HelloWorld/HelloWorld.jpg?raw=true)

Detail
------
ASPIRE simplifies common tasks by providing various functions that wrap around frequently used code. It serves as a three-way interface between the system (MS Windows, any *Nix based system, and even Apple's iOS), the author/developer, and the end user.

One of ASPIRE's key focuses is to enhance the console experience by offering themable designs. You, as the author, can choose from a variety of ASCII-based themes that include colors, symbols, bold and underline fonts, and more. Users also have the option to select a different theme or even create their own (if you allow so (WIP)).

This is just an incomplete preview of options. \
![HelloWorld](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/help/themes/themes_preview_new.jpg?raw=true)

ASPIRE is designed with simplified usability in mind for both end users and developers. \
These functions aim to streamline interactions and improve the overall experience, coding and usage wise.

To name a few of these convenient functions:\
All descriptions are based on the default theme.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| header	| Will print a blue background accross the whole console 'surrounded' by borders.<br>It will accept up to 3 strings.|
| title		| Will print the borders, and fill the space in between with the foreground color (white),<br> and use the background color for the font.<br>This function accepts only 1 string, which will be printed in the center of the line.|
| print		|  Standart output, prints borders in foreground color and accepts up to 3 strings.<br>Will allign them as follows:<br>1. Left<br>2. Left,  Right<br>3. Left, Center, Right |
| ask		| Printing borders and the passed question, encapsules the default ``input``, returns the input. |
| yesno		| Similar to ``ask``, but will only accept yes/no, returns according bool. |
| pick	| Pass a list as argument, uses ``list`` to print them. Returns the string of the shown/entered number. |
| list 		| Used by ``pick`` to print a number to each item of the list |
| bar 		| Provides a progress bar with different options that can be used within the project. |



Usage
-----

The code for the previous preview would look as simple as this, which is how you can use it as library in your projects:

```py
from AspireTUI import tui

tui.header("Aspire by (sea/sri-arjuna)", "Date + Time")
tui.title("Hello World")
tui.print("Left string", "Center string", "Right string")
tui.press()
```

This is how "Hello World" (using ``header``, ``title`` and ``print``) can look like:

Installation
------------

At least thats where i want to go:
```
pip install AspireTUI
```


For an example list of different use cases, please see: [[USAGE](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md)]

Example:
--------

 How the original BASH shell variant with the classic theme looked like: (just to demonstrate how it might look.
