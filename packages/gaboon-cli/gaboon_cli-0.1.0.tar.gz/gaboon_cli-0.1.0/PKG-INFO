Fast to install, test, and run python commands on your smart contracts.

# Speed Comparisons

*The following comparisions were done taking the `user` result from running the bash `time` command followed by the appropriote command on an M3 MacOS*
*Compile command tested with a basic vyper counter contract on version 0.4.0 or 0.3.10 depending on compatibility*

## Background

> The Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica), also called the Gaboon adder, is a viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. Like all other vipers, it is venomous. It is the largest member of the genus Bitis, and has the longest fangs of any venomous snake – up to 2 inches (5 cm) in length – and the highest venom yield of any snake. No subspecies are recognized.
