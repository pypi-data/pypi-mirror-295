"""
This example shows very high numbers for JIT because on import the JitEMD is compiled
making it very efficient. It takes a good 20+ seconds to compile which is hidden.

For this reason, JitEMD is worthy when iterating on live notebook or performing
a lot of the same computation within a single execution. For a single script
with a single EMD execution, it's still much more performant to use normal EMD.
