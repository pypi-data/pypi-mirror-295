    "dataset_description": "A total of 275 women participated in the study for this dataset. Each participant was asked to answer three religiosity items using a 9-point scale. Further, each participant was asked to indicate the typical length of her menstrual cycle, the start date of her last menstrual period, and the start date of her previous menstrual period. In addition, each woman indicated how sure she was about these two start dates, using a 9-point scale. Finally, each woman was asked to indicate her current romantic relationship status with the following four response options: (1) not dating/romantically involved with anyone, (2) dating or involved with only one partner, (3) engaged or living with my partner, and (4) married.",
