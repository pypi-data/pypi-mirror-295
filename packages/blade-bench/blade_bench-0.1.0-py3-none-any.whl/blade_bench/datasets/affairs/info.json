    "Does having children decrease (if at all) the engagement in extramarital affairs? "
  ],
  "data_desc": {
    "dataset_description": "In 1969, the popular magazine Psychology Today published a 101-question survey on sex and asked its readers to mail in their answers. The results of the survey were discussed in the July 1970 issue. From the approximately 2,000 replies that were collected in electronic form (of about 20,000 received), Professor Ray Fair [(1978)](https://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/rayfair/pdf/1978A200.PDF) extracted a sample of 601 observations on men and women then currently married for the first time and analyzed their responses to a question about extramarital affairs. He used the tobit model as a platform. Fair\u2019s analysis in this frequently cited study suggests several interesting econometric questions.",
