Pynxtools-apm offers the atom probe community a set of diverse examples that show how to standardize the diverse (meta)data from the research field of atom probe and field-ion microscopy. We would like to encourage the community to share example files with us. Ideally, these should be small and should come from diverse use cases and file formats.

We are working together with the [International Field Emission Society's (IFES) Atom Probe Technical Committee (APT TC)](https://fieldemission.org/article.php?id=technical_committee) to improve the capabilities of the readers for the benefit of all atom probers.
