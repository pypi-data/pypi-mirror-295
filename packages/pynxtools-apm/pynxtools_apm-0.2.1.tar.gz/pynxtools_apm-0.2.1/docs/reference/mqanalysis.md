# Automated charge state analysis

Each ranging definition is post-processed by the parser and analyzed for whether it is possible to recover
or confirm the charge state. For this the (molecular) ion structure (nuclides and their multiplicity) and
mass-to-charge-state-ratio value is used to constrain a brute force analysis of all possible combinations
of nuclides.
