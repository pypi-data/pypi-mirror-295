# Inspico

[Inspico is a spin-off company of the activities from the Stuttgart atom probe group lead by Prof. Schmitz](https://www.inspico.eu/).
We would be happy to support parsing their formats via the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling library.

Feel free to [file an issue here](https://github.com/atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling) to get in contact with us.
