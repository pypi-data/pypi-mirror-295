hypothesis_gen:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new hypothesis on the {{targets}} in data-driven research and development.
    The {{targets}} are used in a certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them. The user will provide this information to you. Check if a new hypothesis has already been proposed. If it is already generated and you agree with it, just use it. If you don't agree, generate a better one.
    To help you generate new hypothesis, the user has prepared some additional information for you. You should use this information to help generate new {{targets}}.
    Please generate the output following the format and specifications below:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
    Here are the specifications: {{ hypothesis_specification }}

  user_prompt: |-
    If it is not the first round, then the user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows (focus on the last one & the new hypothesis that it provides and reasoning to see if you agree):
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    To help you generate new {{targets}}, we have prepared the following information for you:
    {{ RAG }}
    Please generate the new hypothesis based on the information above. Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows. For those keys, in particular for knowledge, explain in the context of the specific scenario to build up domain knowledge in the specific field rather than genearl knowledge.

hypothesis2experiment:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new {{targets}} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step. 
    The {{targets}} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user will use the {{targets}} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{targets}} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{targets}} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{targets}}.
    Please generate the output following the format below:
    {{ experiment_output_format }}
