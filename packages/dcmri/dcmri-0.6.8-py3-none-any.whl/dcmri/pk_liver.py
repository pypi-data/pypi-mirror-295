def conc_liver(ca, *params, t=None, dt=1.0, kinetics='EC', sum=True, cv=None):
    """Concentration in liver tissue.

    Args:
        ca (array-like): concentration in the arterial input.
        params (tuple): free model parameters.
        t (array_like, optional): the time points in sec of the input function *ca*. If *t* is not provided, the time points are assumed to be uniformly spaced with spacing *dt*. Defaults to None.
        dt (float, optional): spacing in seconds between time points for uniformly spaced time points. This parameter is ignored if *t* is explicity provided. Defaults to 1.0.
        kinetics (str, optional): Kinetics of the tissue, either 'EC', 'IC', 'ICNSU' or 'ICNS'- see below for detail. Defaults to 'EC'. 
        sum (bool, optional): For two-compartment tissues, set to True to return the total tissue concentration. Defaults to True.
        cv (array-like, optional): portal venous concentration for dual-inlet models. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: If sum=True, this is a 1D array with the total concentration at each time point. If sum=False this is the concentration in each compartment, and at each time point, as a 2D array with dimensions *(2,k)*, where *k* is the number of time points in *ca*. The concentration is returned in units of M.

    Notes:
        Currently implemented kinetic models are: 
        
        - 'EC': model for extracellular contrast agent. params = (ve, Te, De,) if cv=None (single-inlet model) and params = (Ta, af, Fp, ve,) otherwise (dual-inlet model).
        - 'IC': model for intracellular contrast agent. params = (ve, Te, De, khe, Th, ) if cv=None (single-inlet model and params = (Ta, af, Fp, ve, khe, Th,) otherwise (dual-inlet model). 
        - 'ICNS': non-stationary model for intracellular contrast agent. params = (ve, Te, De, khe, Th, ) if cv=None (single-inlet model and params = (Ta, af, Fp, ve, khe, Th,) otherwise (dual-inlet model). In this case khe and Th are arrays with 2 or more values.
        - 'ICNSU': non-stationary uptake model for intracellular contrast agent. params = (ve, Te, De, khe, Th, ) if cv=None (single-inlet model and params = (Ta, af, Fp, ve, khe, Th,) otherwise (dual-inlet model). In this case khe is an array with 2 or more values.

        The model parameters are:

        - **Ta** (float, sec): Arterial transit time
        - **af** (float): Arterial flow fraction
        - **Fp** (float, mL/sec/mL): Plasma flow.
        - **ve** (float, mL/mL): liver extracellular volume fraction.
        - **De** (float): Extracellular dispersion in the range [0,1].
        - **Te** (float, sec): Extracellular mean transit time.
        - **khe** (float, mL/sec/mL): Intracellular uptake rate.
        - **Th** (float, sec): hepatocyte mean transit time.

        Plot concentration in cortex and medulla for typical values:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import dcmri as dc

        >>> t = np.arange(0, 30*60, 1.5)
        >>> ca = dc.aif_parker(t, BAT=20)

        Define some parameters and generate plasma and tubular tissue concentrations with a non-stationary model:

        >>> ve, Te, De, khe, Th = 0.2, 30, 0.5, [0.003, 0.01], [180, 600]
        >>> C = dc.conc_liver(ca, ve, Te, De, khe, Th, t=t, sum=False, kinetics='ICNS')
