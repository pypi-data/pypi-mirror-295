# Kathar치 Lab Checker

## What is it?

Kathar치 Lab Checker is a tool to automatically check Kathar치 network scenarios. The tool leverages on a configuration
file (no coding) to specify the tests to run on the scenarios and then outputs files containing the results of the
tests.

The tool is very effective for automatically correct student homeworks, exams and network scenario configurations.

## How does it work?

The Kathar치 Lab Checker takes in input a configuration file specifying the tests to perform and the expected values.
To run the tool you only need to run the `main.py` passing the desired configuration file.

```bash
python3 -m main.py --config <path-to-the-configuration-file>
```

At this point, the tool parses the provided configuration file and executes the tests. For each network scenario the
tool creates a `test_results.xlsx` file in the network scenario directory.

The file is composed of three sheets:
1. `Summary`: Contains a summary of the results.
2. `All`: Contains the results for each test.
3. `Failed`: Contains only the results of failed tests.

After all the network scenarios are tested, the tool outputs an excell file `results.xlsx` in the network scenarios
directory containing all the results for each network scenario, including the reasons for failed tests. 

## Running the example
The repository already provide a complete example with the results of the tests. 
- Check the test configuration by inspecting: [configuration_palabra.json](examples/palabra/configuration_palabra.json).
- Check the network topology and requisites: [palabra.pdf](examples/palabra/palabra.pdf)
- Check final results summary: [results.xlsx](examples/palabra/results.xlsx)

You can re-run the example by typing the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
python3 src/main.py --config examples/configuration_palabra.json --no-cache
```

The `--no-cache` flag force to repeat already executed tests.

## How to configure?

In the following you will find the possible values for the configuration file.
