Data Twinning
=============
An efficient implementation of the twinning algorithm proposed in Vakayil and Joseph (2022) for partitioning a dataset into statistically similar twin sets. The algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the ``SPlit`` algorithm proposed in Joseph and Vakayil (2021) for optimally splitting a dataset into training and testing sets, and the ``support points`` algorithm of Mak and Joseph (2018) for subsampling from Big Data.

The module provides functions ``twin()``, ``multiplet()``, and ``energy()``. 

- ``twin()`` partitions datasets into statistically similar disjoint sets, termed as *twins*. The twins themselves are statistically similar to the original dataset (Vakayil and Joseph, 2022). Such a partition can be employed for optimal training and testing of statistical and machine learning models (Joseph and Vakayil, 2021). The twins can be of unequal size; for tractable model building on large datasets, the smaller twin can serve as a compression (lossy) of the original dataset. 

- ``multiplet()`` is an extension of ``twin()`` to generate multiple disjoint partitions that can be used for *k*-fold cross validation, or with divide-and-conquer procedures. 

- ``energy()`` computes the energy distance (Székely and Rizzo, 2013) between a given dataset and a set of points, which is the metric minimized by twinning.
