# Using the `crypto` API Client

The `crypto` API client provided by the `quantsumore` package allows users to easily fetch both real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data. This guide will walk you through importing the `crypto` API client and using its methods.

## Importing the Crypto API Client

To start using the `crypto` API client, you need to import it from the `quantsumore.api` package. The `crypto` import provides access to an instance of the `APIClient` class, configured specifically for cryptocurrency data.

```python
from quantsumore.api import crypto
```

## Fetching Latest Cryptocurrency Market Data

To fetch the latest market data for a specific cryptocurrency, you can use the `cLatest` method. This method allows you to specify various parameters, such as the cryptocurrency's slug, base currency, quote currency, exchange, and more.

### Example: Fetching Latest Data for Bitcoin

```python
# Fetch the latest market data for Bitcoin, quoted in USD
latest_data = crypto.cLatest(slug="bitcoin", baseCurrencySymbol="USD", quoteCurrencySymbol="JPY", cryptoExchange="binance", limit=100, exchangeType="all")

# Print the retrieved data
print(latest_data)
```

This example will retrieve the most recent trading data for Bitcoin (BTC) in USD, using the Binance exchange, and display it as a pandas DataFrame.

## Fetching Historical Cryptocurrency Data

To get historical data for a specific cryptocurrency, you can use the `cHistorical` method. You will need to specify the `slug` for the cryptocurrency and the date range (`start` and `end`) for which you want the historical data.

### Example: Fetching Historical Data for Bitcoin

```python
# Fetch historical data for Bitcoin from January 1, 2024, to January 10, 2024
historical_data = crypto.cHistorical(slug="bitcoin", start="2024-01-01", end="2024-01-10")

# Print the historical data
print(historical_data)
```

This example retrieves the historical price and trading volume data for Bitcoin over a specified date range and displays it as a pandas DataFrame.

# Using the `cpi` API Client`

The `cpi` API client provided by the `quantsumore` package allows users to easily fetch Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for all urban consumers and perform inflation adjustments based on historical CPI values. This guide will walk you through importing the `cpi` API client and using its methods.

## Importing the CPI API Client

To start using the `cpi` API client, you need to import it from the `quantsumore.api` package. The `cpi` import provides access to an instance of the `APIClient` class, configured specifically for CPI data.

```python
from quantsumore.api import cpi
```

## Accessing CPI Data and Inflation Adjustment

The `cpi` API client includes a special property called `CPI_U` that provides access to inflation adjustment functionalities.

### 1. Accessing CPI Data for All Urban Consumers

The `CPI_U` property provides CPI data for all urban consumers in the United States. This data is automatically fetched and processed when accessed.

```python
# Access CPI data for all urban consumers
cpi_data = cpi.CPI_U.InflationAdjustment.data

# Display the fetched CPI data
print(cpi_data)
```

### 2. Performing Inflation Adjustments

The `InflationAdjustment` instance allows users to perform various inflation adjustment calculations based on CPI data.

#### Example: Adjusting an Amount Between Years

To calculate the inflation-adjusted value of an amount from one year to another:

```python
# Adjust $100 from the year 2000 to its equivalent in 2024, using July as the reference month
adjusted_value = cpi.CPI_U.InflationAdjustment.select(original_amount=100, original_year=2000, target_year=2024, month_input="July")

# Display the adjusted value
print(f"Adjusted value: ${adjusted_value}")
```

### 3. Year-by-Year Inflation Adjustments

To calculate how the value of a given amount has changed over a specified number of years:

```python
# Calculate how $100 has changed in value over the past 10 years
year_by_year_changes = cpi.CPI_U.InflationAdjustment.year_by_year(original_amount=100, n_years=10)

# Display the year-by-year changes
print(year_by_year_changes)
```

### 4. Month-by-Month Inflation Adjustments for the Current Year

To calculate the inflation-adjusted value of an amount against CPI values for each month of the current year:

```python
# Calculate monthly adjustments for $100 in the current year
month_by_month_adjustments = cpi.CPI_U.InflationAdjustment.month_by_month(amount=100)

# Display the month-by-month adjustments
print(month_by_month_adjustments)
```
