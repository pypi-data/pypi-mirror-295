# Reporting Pool

A simple wrapper around Python multiprocessing Pool that allows tracking of progress and storage of exceptions. 

While starmap runs, a report is printed that shows % of jobs completed, time elapsed, estimated remaining time and a list of jobs statuses. Status can be: 
    Q -- queued,
    R -- running,
    S -- success,
    F -- failed (in case track_failures is enabled).

The wrapper runs [multiprocessing.pool.starmap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap) on the `func` and `p_args` (see [Examples](#Examples)). 

Enabling `track_failures` allows native tracking of failed function runs. For other arguments, see help(ReportingPool).

For many people, a [tqdm tracking of parallel processes](https://leimao.github.io/blog/Python-tqdm-Multiprocessing/) would be a simpler solution. The Reporting Pool is useful when each process prints a lot of information that cannot be suppressed, so a high-frequency reporting is useful, and can raise exceptions for unpredictable reasons breaking program flow.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

This project's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nishbo/reporting_pool).

### Prerequisites

Software:
- Python 3+ (tested on 3.7, 3.8, 3.11, 3.12)

### Installation

Reporting pool can now be installed from pypi:

```
py -m pip install reporting_pool
```

#### Install from source

1. Download the [repository](https://github.com/nishbo/reporting_pool) or clone it using git: `git clone https://github.com/nishbo/reporting_pool.git`.
2. Open Terminal, Command Line, or the desired Anaconda environment in the project folder.
3. Run `python setup.py install`.

## Examples

Example of a normal use:

```
from reporting_pool import ReportingPool

def _reporting_pool_test_func_wof(v):
    time.sleep(0.25)
    return v**2

p_args = [[v] for v in range(40)]

pool = ReportingPool(_reporting_pool_test_func_wof, p_args, processes=8,
                     report_on_change=True)
res = pool.start()

print(res)
```

Output:
```

```

Example where the function can throw exceptions:

```
from reporting_pool import ReportingPool

# a function that throws an error
def _reporting_pool_test_func_wf(v):
    time.sleep(0.25)
    if v % 6 == 0:
        raise ValueError()
    return v**2

p_args = [[v] for v in range(40)]

pool = ReportingPool(_reporting_pool_test_func_wf, p_args,
                     report_rate=20, track_failures=True)
res = pool.start()

print(res)
```
