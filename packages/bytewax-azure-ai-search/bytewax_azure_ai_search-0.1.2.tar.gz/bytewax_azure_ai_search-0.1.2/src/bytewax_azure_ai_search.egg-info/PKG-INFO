License: # Software License Agreement
        
        The terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement (this
        "License Agreement") govern your use of the accompanying Bytewax Module
        software (the "Software") and constitute a binding legal contract
        between you and Bytewax, Inc. ("Bytewax"). Your download, installation
        or use of the Software constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement.
        If you do not agree to any part of this License Agreement, then you may
        not use the Software and must delete all copies of the Software in your
        possession or control.
        
        If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement on behalf of a legal
        entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
        that legal entity to the terms of this License Agreement, and, in such
        event, "you" and "your" will refer to that legal entity. If you do not
        have such authority, you must not accept this License Agreement, in
        which case you may not download or use the Software.
        
        1.  Subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement and
            your timely payment of all subscription fees due hereunder, Bytewax
            hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license
            (without right to sublicense) to: (i) install and use the object
            code version of the Software internally for the purpose of ingesting
            and processing data for your own internal business purposes;
            and (ii) incorporate the Software, solely in object code form or
            code artifact, as a component of software-as-a-service offering that
            is hosted by you ("Application"), provided that such Application
            provides material additional functionality and features in addition
            to that provided by the Software.
        
        2.  Subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement and
            your timely payment of all subscription fees due hereunder, Bytewax
            hereby grants you, a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license
            to internally use any documentation that may be provided by Bytewax
            regarding the Software ("Documentation") as reasonably necessary for
            your authorized use of the Software. You may make copies of the
            Documentation in connection with exercising the foregoing license.
            Without limiting any other terms and conditions of this License
            Agreement, you may not transfer or provide the Documentation to any
            third party.
        
        3.  You shall be entitled to download and use any updated versions of
            the Software that Bytewax may make available to similarly situated
            licensees in its sole discretion. Any such updated versions
            constitute the "Software" for all purposes hereunder. In addition,
            Bytewax will use commercially reasonable efforts to answer questions
            regarding use of the Software during Bytewax's normal business hours
            through such support channels as Bytewax may make available from
            time to time.
        
        4.  You have no rights or licenses with respect to the Software or
            Documentation except as expressly provided in this License
            Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may
            not, except to the extent expressly provided for in Sections 1 and 2
            above: (a) copy, distribute, rent, lease, lend, sublicense or
            transfer the Software or Documentation or use the Software or
            Documentation on a service bureau basis; (b) decompile, reverse
            engineer, or disassemble the Software or otherwise attempt to
            discover the source code of the Software, except solely to the
            extent such acts are authorized under applicable law notwithstanding
            this prohibition; (c) create derivative works based on the Software
            or Documentation; (d) modify, remove, or obscure any copyright,
            trademark, patent or other notices or legends that may appear on the
            Software or Documentation or during the use and operation
            thereof; (e) cause the Software to become subject to the terms of
            any open source license agreement; or (f) deploy your Application in
            a manner that allows the end user to directly access, download or
            use the Software other than as incorporated within your Application.
            acknowledge that certain components of the Software may be covered by
            open source software licenses. To the extent the terms of such open
            source licenses prohibit any of the restrictions in this License
            Agreement with respect to the applicable open source software, such
            restrictions do not apply. To the extent the terms of such open
            source licenses require Bytewax to make an offer to provide source
            code or related information in connection with the open source
            software, such offer is hereby made. You are not required to provide
            any ideas, feedback or suggestions regarding the Software
            (collectively, "Feedback") to Bytewax. To the extent you do provide
            any Feedback to Bytewax, you acknowledge that Bytewax may freely use,
            reproduce, modify, distribute, make, have made, sell, offer for sale,
            import and otherwise exploit in any manner such Feedback without
            payment of any royalties or other consideration to you.
        
        5.  As part of its operation, the Software may collect and send to
            Bytewax data regarding the system on which the Software is installed
            and relating to usage of the Software ("Collected Data"). Collected
            Data will not include the data that you ingest or process through
            use of the Software. Collected Data may be used by or on behalf of
            Bytewax for any lawful purpose, including without limitation to
            develop and improve Bytewax's products and services and for
            statistical analysis purposes. In addition, Bytewax will disclose
            Collected Data where Bytewax, in good faith, believes that the law
            or legal process (such as a court order, search warrant or subpoena)
            requires Bytewax to do so or in other circumstances where Bytewax
            believes it is necessary to protect the rights or property of
            Bytewax or third parties.
        
        6.  For the avoidance of doubt, you may not directly or indirectly
            utilize the Software as an embedded component of any device or
            system or as part of any software application that is distributed.
            The Software is licensed solely for your internal use or use in an
            Application as set forth in Section 1. If you wish to request a
            license for any other purpose, please contact Bytewax at
            sales@bytewax.io.
        
        7.  You may only make your Application available under terms and
            conditions that: (i) do not conflict with any provision of this
            License Agreement or Bytewax's rights in and to the Software; (ii)
            are not materially less protective of the Software and Bytewax's
            rights therein and thereto than the provisions of this License
            Agreement; (iii) do not make any representations, warranties or
            covenants regarding the Software or on behalf of Bytewax; (iv) state
            that the Application incorporates the Software and that Bytewax owns
            all copyright and other intellectual property rights in and to the
            Software; (v) disclaim any and all warranties and liability on
            behalf of Bytewax to the maximum extent allowable under applicable
            law; and (vi) are presented to and accepted by the Application end
            user in a manner sufficient to create a binding legal agreement
            under applicable law.
        
        8.  The Software and Documentation are licensed, not sold. The Software
            and Documentation provided hereunder are the property of Bytewax or
            its third-party licensors. Bytewax shall retain all right, title and
            ownership interest and all worldwide patent, copyright, trade
            secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights and other
            proprietary rights in and to the Software and Documentation and any
            copies, derivative works, upgrades, updates, improvements and
            modifications thereof, in, regardless of the form or media in which,
            or on which, the original and any other copies, derivative works,
            upgrades, updates, improvements or modifications may exist.
        
        9.  You agree to pay all subscription fees for the Software for the
            applicable subscription term you select ("Subscription Term"), as
            set forth on our website. Each Subscription Term shall automatically
            renew for a Subscription Term of equal length until you cancel the
            subscription on or before the end of the then current Subscription
            Term, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with this License
            Agreement. You agree to provide a valid credit card or other
            approved payment mechanism for paying subscription fees and other
            charges. You authorize us to charge your credit card or other
            payment mechanism for any subscription fees and charges that you may
            incur in connection with your account or use of the Software. We
            reserve the right to change the fee structure and fees charged for
            the Software at any time. We will provide you with thirty days
            advance notice (which may be by email) of changes to the fee
            structure and fees. By continuing use of the Software following that
            thirty day notice period, you agree to the updated fee structure and
            fees. You acknowledge that if you object to the proposed change(s),
            your sole remedy is to cancel your subscription. All fees are
            exclusive of any taxes required by applicable law, and you agree to
            pay or reimburse Bytewax for any all taxes relating to this License
            Agreement, other than taxes based on Bytewax's net income.
        
        10. If you breach any provision of this License Agreement or cancel your
            subscription, this License Agreement (including all of your rights
            and licenses with respect to the Software and Documentation) shall
            immediately terminate without further notice from or action by
            Bytewax. Bytewax may decline to renew your subscription and
            terminate this License Agreement at the end of the Subscription Term
            for any or no reason upon notice (including by email) to you. Upon
            termination or expiration of this License Agreement, you agree to
            cease all use of the Software and Documentation (including by
            removing it from your Application) and to delete all copies thereof
            in your possession or control. The provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6,
            8, 9 (with respect to accrued but unpaid fees), 11 through 22 and
            this Section 10 shall survive any termination or expiration of this
            Agreement according to their terms.
        
        11. You agree that Bytewax may state in the public domain that you are a
            user of the Software, and may include references to and screenshots
            of your Applications in Bytewax's marketing and publicity materials.
        
        12. THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE FURNISHED "AS IS". BYTEWAX MAKES
            NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE
            SOFTWARE AND THE DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THEIR
            QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS
            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION IS WITH YOU. BYTEWAX
            HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT OR ASSISTANCE RELATING TO
            YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.
        
        13. IN NO EVENT SHALL BYTEWAX BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT,
            SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
            LICENSE AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF BYTEWAX HAS
            BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH POTENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE AND
            REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL BYTEWAX 'S
            AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RELATION TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
            EXCEED FEES PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD
            PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF
            LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN DAMAGES SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS
            OF THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND
            REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS OR EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER REMEDIES.
        
        14. You agree to indemnify and hold Bytewax and its affiliated
            companies, and each of their directors, officers, employees,
            contractors, suppliers and partners, harmless from any claims,
            losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including
            attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to your use or misuse of
            the Software (including without limitation your commercialization of
            any Application), breach of this Agreement or violation of the
            rights of any other person or entity, except solely to the extent
            any of the foregoing arise out of the willful misconduct or gross
            negligence of Bytewax or an IP Claim for which Bytewax is obligated
            under Section 15 below. Bytewax reserves the right, at your expense,
            to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which
            you are required to indemnify the Bytewax and you agree to cooperate
            with Bytewax's defense of these claims.
        
        15. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Bytewax agrees to, at
            its own expense, defend and/or settle any claim, action or suit
            brought by a third party against you alleging that Software
            infringes such third party's intellectual property rights (an "IP
            Claim"), and Bytewax will pay those amounts finally awarded by a
            court of competent jurisdiction against the Company Indemnitees, or
            payable pursuant to a settlement agreed to by Bytewax with respect
            to the IP Claim, provided that you promptly notify Bytewax in
            writing of the IP Claim, tender sole control of the defense and
            settlement thereof to Bytewax and provide Bytewax with all
            reasonably requested information and assistance in connection with
            the IP Claim. If Bytewax, in its sole discretion, believes an IP
            Claim or an adverse judgment in connection with an IP Claim is
            likely, then Bytewax may, at its option, (a) obtain a license from
            such third party claimant that allows you to continue the use of the
            Software, (b) modify the Software so as to be non-infringing, or (c)
            terminate this License Agreement. Bytewax will have no obligation or
            liability relating to any IP Claim that: (x) is based on
            modification or customization of the Software by you or any person
            or entity other than Bytewax; (y) is based on the combination or use
            of the Software (or any component of either) with any software,
            hardware, system, method, device or materials not provided by
            Bytewax; or (z) results from your use of the Software in a manner
            that is inconsistent with its intended use or is in breach of this
            Agreement. This Section 15 sets forth the entire liability of
            Bytewax and your sole and exclusive remedy in the event of any claim
            that the Software infringes any third party intellectual property
            right.
        
        16. Bytewax may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this
            License Agreement ("Changes") at any time. Changes will be
            effective: (i) thirty (30) days after Bytewax sends notice of the
            Changes to the e-mail address associated with your account; or (ii)
            when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a
            version of this License Agreement incorporating the Changes,
            whichever comes first. In addition, this License Agreement may be
            modified by an amendment signed by authorized representatives of you
            and Bytewax. This License Agreement may not be modified or amended
            other than as set forth in this Section 16.
        
        17. To the extent that you are an agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
            government, the parties agree that the Software and Documentation
            are commercial computer software and commercial computer software
            documentation, respectively, and that your rights therein are as
            specified in this License Agreement, per FAR 12.212 and DEARS
            227.7202-3, as applicable, or in the case of NASA, subject to NFS
            1852.227-86.
        
        18. You may not assign your rights under this License Agreement without
            the express prior consent of Bytewax. If you are a legal entity, any
            merger involving you, acquisition of all or substantially all of
            your assets or change of control shall be deemed an assignment of
            this Agreement for which prior written consent is required. Bytewax
            may freely assign this License Agreement.
        
        19. The Software may be subject to export laws and regulations. You
            agree to comply with any United States and international export laws
            and regulations that may apply.
        
        20. This License Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
            accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving
            effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any action arising out
            of or relating to this License Agreement shall be filed only in the
            state or federal courts of the Northern District of California and
            you and Bytewax hereby consent and submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such
            action.
        
        21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Bytewax may apply to any
            court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable
            relief.
        
        22. This License Agreement and the User Agreement for Bytewax is the
            complete and final agreement of the parties with respect to the
            Software and Documentation. If any part of this License Agreement is
            found to be void, unenforceable or invalid, that part will be deemed
            stricken and will not affect the validity of the other provisions.
            Failure by Bytewax to enforce any provision of this License
            Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that
            or any other provision.

These are used to write the vectors on the appropriate services based on an Azure schema provided. We will provide an example in this README for working versions of schema definition under these versions.

## Setting up Azure AI services

**This asumes you have set up an Azure AI Search service on the Azure portal. For more instructions, visit [their documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)**

**Optional**
To generate embeddings, you can set up an [Azure OpenAI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) and deploy an embedding model such as `text-ada-002-embedding`

Once you have set up the resources, ensure to idenfity and store the following information from the Azure portal:

* You Azure AI Search admin key
* You Azure AI Search service name
* You Azure AI Search service endpoint url

If you deployed an embedding model through Azure AI OpenAI service:

* You Azure OpenAI endpoint url
* You Azure OpenAI API key
* Your Azure OpenAI service name
* You Azure OpenAI embedding deployment name
* Your Azure OpenAI embedding name (e.g. text-ada-002-embedding`)

## Sample usage

You can find a complete example under the [`examples/` folder](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax-azure-ai-search/tree/main/examples).

To execute the examples, you can generate a `.env` file with the following keywords:

```bash
# OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT= <your-azure-openai-endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY= <your-azure-openai-key>
AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE=<your-azure-openai-named-service>
# Azure Document Search
AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY=<your-azure-ai-search-admin-key>
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE=<your-azure-ai-search-named-service>
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=<your-azure-ai-search-endpoint-url>

# Optional - if you prefer to generate embeddings with embedding models deployed on Azure
AZURE_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-azure-openai-given-deployment-name>
AZURE_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=<your-azure-openai-model-name>

# Optional - if you prefer to generate the embeddings with OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
```

Set up the connection and schema by running

```bash
python connection.py
```

You can verify the creation of the index was successful by visiting the portal.

![](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax-azure-ai-search/blob/main/docs/images/sample-index.png)

If you click on the created index and press "Search" you can verify it was created - but empty at this point.

![](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax-azure-ai-search/blob/main/docs/images/sample-empty-index.png)

Generate the embeddings and store in Azure AI Search through the bytewax-azure-ai-search sink

```bash
python -m bytewax.run dataflow:flow
```

Verify the index was populated by pressing "Search" with an empty query.

![](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax-azure-ai-search/blob/main/docs/images/sample-filled-index.png)

**Note**

In the dataflow we initialized the custom sink as follows:

```python
from bytewax.bytewax_azure_ai_search import AzureSearchSink

azure_sink = AzureSearchSink(
    azure_search_service=service_name,
    index_name="bytewax-index",
    search_api_version="2024-07-01",
    search_admin_key=api_key,
    schema={
        "id": {"type": "string", "default": None},
        "content": {"type": "string", "default": None},
        "meta": {"type": "string", "default": None},
        "vector": {"type": "collection", "item_type": "single", "default": []},
    },
)
```

The schema and structure need to match how you configure the schema through the Azure AI Search Python API. For more information, [visit their page](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/)

In this example:

```python
from azure.search.documents.indexes.models import (
    SimpleField,
    SearchFieldDataType,
)

# Define schema
fields = [
    SimpleField(
        name="id",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
        filterable=True,
        sortable=True,
        facetable=True,
        key=True,
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="content",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
        filterable=False,
        sortable=False,
        facetable=False,
        key=False,
    ),
    SearchableField(
        name="meta",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.String,
        searchable=True,
        filterable=False,
        sortable=False,
        facetable=False,
        key=False,
    ),
    SimpleField(
        name="vector",
        type=SearchFieldDataType.Collection(SearchFieldDataType.Double),
        searchable=False,
        filterable=False,
        sortable=False,
        facetable=False,
        vector_search_dimensions=DIMENSIONS,
        vector_search_profile_name="myHnswProfile",
    ),
]
```

## For developers - Setting up the project

### Install `just`

We use [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) as a command runner for
actions / recipes related to developing Bytewax. Please follow [the
installation
instructions](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
There's probably a package for your OS already.

### Install `pyenv` and Python 3.12

I suggest using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
to manage python versions.
[the installation instructions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

You can also use your OS's package manager to get access to different
Python versions.

Ensure that you have Python 3.12 installed and available as a "global
shim" so that it can be run anywhere. The following will make plain
`python` run your OS-wide interpreter, but will make 3.12 available
via `python3.12`.

```console
$ pyenv global system 3.12
```

### Install `uv`

We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a virtual
environment creator, package installer, and dependency pin-er. There
are [a few different ways to install
it](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started),
but I recommend installing it through either
[`brew`](https://brew.sh/) on macOS or
[`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).

## Development

We have a `just` recipe that will:

1. Set up a venv in `venvs/dev/`.

2. Install all dependencies into it in a reproducible way.

Start by adding any dependencies that are needed into [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) or into
[requirements/dev.in](requirements/dev.in) if they are needed for development.

Next, generate the pinned set of dependencies with

```console
> just venv-compile-all
```

## Create and activate a virtual environment

Once you have compiled your dependencies, run the following:

```console
> just get-started
```

Activate your development environment and run the development task:

```console
> . venvs/dev/bin/activate
> just develop
```
