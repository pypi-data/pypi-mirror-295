Currently NearBeach has the ability to;

* Project
* Tasks
* Kanban Boards
* Requirements/Requirement Items
* Request for Changes (RFC)
* Setup Customer/Organisation information


-------
Project

Start a project and connect it to an existing organisation and customers.


-----
Tasks

For those smaller tasks, you can easily create a task and connect it to existing organisations and customers.

Organisations & Customers
-------------------------
At the end of the day, you need to know what project/task/etc is for which Customer and Organisation. You'll need to key
these customers/organisations into NearBeach. We currently do have the ability to house that data within NearBeach.
