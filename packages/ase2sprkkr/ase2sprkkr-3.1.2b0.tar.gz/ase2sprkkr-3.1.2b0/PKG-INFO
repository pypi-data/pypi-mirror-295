# ASE2SPRKKR

ASE2SPRKKR package provide an interface that allow use of the [SPR-KKR
package](https://www.ebert.cup.uni-muenchen.de/index.php/en/software-en/13-sprkkr)
to electronic structure calculation within [Atomic Simulation
Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (abbreviated as ASE)
\-\--Python tool that integrates the various tools for electronic
structure calculation.

## Installation of the package using package managers

The simplest way how to install and use the package is to install them
using package managers: either pip

``` bash
pip install ase2sprkkr
```

or conda

``` bash
conda install -c ase2sprkkr ase2sprkkr
```

### Further notes

In some systems, the `pip` utility for `python3` is called `pip3`. If it
is not installed, you can install it using the linux distribution
package manager, e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu

``` bash
apt install pip3
```

or

``` bash
zypper install pip
```

in OpenSUSE

For the conda installation instructions, see the Anaconda documentation
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/> however, for the
users unexperienced with conda, the (simpler) pip way is recommended.

## Install the packages from GIT (and/or source codes)

If you do not want to use public package managers as pip or conda, or
you want to contribute to development, you can use GIT to obtain the
package sources.

### Requirements

-   Python \>= 3.7
-   SPR-KKR (not checked by the installer)
-   Python packages: see the the setup.cfg
-   Git (to obtain the sources)

### Obtaining the package using GIT

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ase2sprkkr/ase2sprkkr.git
git checkout release
```

The first line fetches the code of the package. The second one checks
out the recommended production version of the code.

If you want to obtain the current version of the (earlier-downloaded)
code, run

``` bash
git fetch
git checkout release
```

Alternatively, you can checkout `master` or `develop` branch

``` bash
git checkout master
```

to obtain a newer (not thorougly tested yet) version or

``` bash
git checkout develop
```

to obtain the bleeding edge version (feel free to try it, test it and
report the bugs).

### Using the package (without installing the pip/conda packages)

Install ninja a meson:
```
apt install ninja-build
pip install meson-python
``

Do an editable install

``
pip install --editable .
``

### Installation of the package from the sources

To install the package, the simplest way is to use pip

``` bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

Maybe, you will have to replace `python3` with `python`. For an editable
install, please run

``` bash
python3 setup.py develop --user
```

and ignore some deprecation warning. Editable install is aimed for
developers: in this type of install, only link to the current directory
will be added to your local `site-packages`, which allows you to use the
changesyou make to the source code.

## Documentation of the package

The documentation is published online at
<https://ase2sprkkr.github.io/ase2sprkkr/>

If you are using Git cloned sources, you can run

    open docs/index.html

to see the (offline version of the) documentation. The documentation
contains parts, that are generated from the docstrings in the source
code. You can regenerate these by

``` bash
make docs
```

Sphinx and sphinx-toolbox python packages (installable e.g. using pip)
and pandoc (for generating README.md) are needed for the build.

However, the official build of Sphinx miss some attributes when it is
used to build the documentation. So, till the pullrequest that corrects
the Sphinx behavior will be merged into Sphinx, please use the following
fork for building the documentation.
<https://github.com/lokik/sphinx.git>
