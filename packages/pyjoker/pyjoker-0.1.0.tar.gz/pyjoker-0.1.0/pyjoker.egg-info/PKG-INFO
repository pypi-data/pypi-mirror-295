        **PyJoker** is a Python package that provides categorized one-liner jokes. You can either get a random joke or a joke from a specific category like `dad`, `tech`, etc.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the package via `pip` after it's published to PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        pip install pyjoker
        
        
        Alternatively, if you're developing locally, you can install it by navigating to the project directory and running:
        pip install .
        
        Usage
        Hereâ€™s how you can use PyJoker:
        
        Get a Random Joke
        To get a random joke, call the get_joke() function with 'rand' as the argument:
        
        import pyjoker
        
        # Get a random joke
        print(pyjoker.get_joke('rand'))
        
        Get a Joke from a Specific Category
        
        To get a joke from a specific category, pass the category name as a string. Example categories include:
        
        1. puns
        2. observational
        3. deprecating
        4. dark
        5. sarcasm

        import pyjoker
        
        # Get a random 'dad' joke
        print(pyjoker.get_joke('dad'))
        
        # Get a random 'tech' joke
        print(pyjoker.get_joke('tech'))
        
        ------
