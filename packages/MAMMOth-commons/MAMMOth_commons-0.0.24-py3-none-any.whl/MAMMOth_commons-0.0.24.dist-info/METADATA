# MAMMOth-commons

Fast component development for the MAMMOth fairness toolkit.
Components refer to model loaders, dataset loaders, or metrics.
The library holds common datatypes that are shared between
components, and automates the integration strategy by only
needing to add a decorator.

## :clipboard: Catalogue

Find a catalogue of modules implemented by the MAMMOth consortium
[here](catalogue/README.md). These modules are developed by and
depend on datatypes found in commons.
