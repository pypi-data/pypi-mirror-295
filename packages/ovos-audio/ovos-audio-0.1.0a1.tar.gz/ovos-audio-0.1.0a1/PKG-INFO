Description: # ovos-audio
        
        The "mouth" of the OVOS assistant!
        
        Handles TTS generation and sounds playback
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install ovos-audio[extras]` to install this package and the default
        plugins.
        
        Without `extras`, you will also need to manually install,
        and possibly configure TTS modules as described below.
        
        # Configuration
        
        under mycroft.conf
        
        ```javascript
        {
        
          // Text to Speech parameters
          "tts": {
            "module": "ovos-tts-plugin-server",
            "fallback_module": "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic",
            "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic": {
                "voice": "ap"
            }
          },
        
          // File locations of sounds to play for system events
          "sounds": {
            "start_listening": "snd/start_listening.wav",
            "end_listening": "snd/end_listening.wav",
            "acknowledge": "snd/acknowledge.mp3",
            "error": "snd/error.mp3"
          },
        
          // Mechanism used to play WAV audio files
          "play_wav_cmdline": "paplay %1 --stream-name=mycroft-voice",
        
          // Mechanism used to play MP3 audio files
          "play_mp3_cmdline": "mpg123 %1",
        
          // Mechanism used to play OGG audio files
          "play_ogg_cmdline": "ogg123 -q %1"
        }
        ```
        
        ## Using Legacy AudioService
        
        The legacy audio service supports audio playback via the old mycroft api ([@mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/dev/mycroft/skills/audioservice.py#L43) [@ovos](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-bus-client/blob/dev/ovos_bus_client/apis/ocp.py#L51))
        
        by default OCP acts as a translation layer for this api and no action is needed, but if you want to disable ocp this api remains available
        
        > **NOTE:** once ovos-media is released OCP and this api will be disabled by default and deprecated!
        
        ```javascript
        {
            "enable_old_audioservice": true,
            "disable_ocp": true,
            "Audio": {
                "default-backend": "vlc",
                "backends": {
                  "simple": {
                    "type": "ovos_audio_simple",
                    "active": true
                  },
                  "vlc": {
                    "type": "ovos_vlc",
                    "active": true
                  }
                }
            }
          },
        }
        ```
        
        legacy plugins:
        - [ocp](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-ocp-audio-plugin)
        - [vlc](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-vlc-plugin)
        - [simple](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-audio-plugin-simple) (no https support)
        
        **OCP technical details:**
        
        - OCP was developed for mycroft-core under this legacy system
        - OCP will pose as a legacy plugin and translate the received bus events to the [OCP api](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-bus-client/blob/dev/ovos_bus_client/apis/ocp.py#L228)
        - OCP is **always** the default audio plugin, unless you set `"disable_ocp": true` in config
        - OCP uses the legacy api internally, to delegate playback when GUI is not available (or configured to do so)
        - this does **NOT** bring support for old Mycroft CommonPlay skills, that is related to skills service not ovos-audio
        - this brings support for [OCP skills](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/OCP_skills) to OVOS until [ovos-media](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media) is finished
        - [ovos-media](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media) will fully replace OCP in **ovos-audio 0.2.0**
