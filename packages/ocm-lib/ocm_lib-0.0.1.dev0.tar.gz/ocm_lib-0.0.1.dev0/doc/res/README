Usage / Editing
===============

This directory contains graphical image files intended to be referenced by documentation documents.
In case an image is created from a source format, always add (and update!) the source file. Name
the source file identical to the output file (with a different file name extension, obviously).

In case the adequate tool to use is not obvious, also state how to edit the source file.
