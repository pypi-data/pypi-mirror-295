# ### Pre-Journal Calculations
# 
# From the ITRPVs, we have grams of Ag per cell from 2009 through 2019, with projections through 2030. Data for silver per cell for 4 different types of cell were extracted from ITRPV graphs with "webplotdigitizer" then rounded to ~2 significant figures. The 4 types of cell noted in ITRPV 2019 and 2020 are Monofacial p-type, Bifacial p-type, HJT n-type, and n-type. Some mathmatical assumptions:
# 
# 1) n-type cells account for only 5% of the world market share and have for the last decade. While the amount of silver in the two different n-type cells is noteably different, because their marketshare is so small, these two n-type cell silver quantities were averaged together.
# 
# 2) The difference in silver per cell between bifacial and monofacial cells is not significant, and were therefore averaged together.
# 
# Therefore the process for determining the average silver per cell across the different technologies was:
# 
#         average silver per cell = 0.95*(average of monofacial and bifacial p-type) + 0.05*(average of n-type)
#         
# This math was completed in the google spreadsheet of raw data
# <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing>
# then copied to a csv and is uploaded here.

# ### Extend projection through 2050
# It appears that the silver per cell is expected to level out by 2025 or so. We will extend 2030 values through 2050 as a "lower limit" or minimal further improvement.
