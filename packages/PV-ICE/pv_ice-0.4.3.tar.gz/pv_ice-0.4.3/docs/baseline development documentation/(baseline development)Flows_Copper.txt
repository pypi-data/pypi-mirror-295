Copper Baseline Flows Assumptions

See the Jupyter Journal for the derivation of g/m^2 of module of copper.

Based on a 2003 book about copper flows and impacts, they state the global average is 125 tons of ore are mined to generate 1 ton of copper ore [pg 15], or 0.8% efficiency at the mine mouth (excluding overburden). The roasting and smelting processes result in slag with 0.5% to 10% copper content [pg 19], some of which can be recovered by secondary processes; if we assume that 5% of the slag copper content can be recovered, then we can assume a 95% efficiency for roasting and smelting. Multiplying 0.8%*95% = a 76% virgin material efficiency for copper, which falls between the 62% and 88% efficiency [page 21]. R. U. Ayres, L. W. Ayres, and I. Råde, The Life Cycle of Copper, Its Co-Products and Byproducts. Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, 2003.

For Copper, we assume a 90% manufacturing efficiency, since the primary manufacturing waste would be trimmings from tabbing and cabling. We also 98% assume that all this "new scrap" is recycled (accounting for some lost in collection). Globally and in North America, only 2% of copper is lost from recycling high grade or "new scrap" copper. Therefore, the MFG recycling efficiency will be 98% (copper flows from North America, 10/500 Mton = 2% losses). S. Hernandez, L. Yusheng, and R.

Currently and historically, recycling of PV panels is minimal to non-existant. The current recycling process in the EU, done to comply with WEEE Directive, only recycles copper of the cabling and junction box, and does not attempt to recover copper internal to the module. Given that this baseline represents the module encapsulated copper only, we will set "mat_EoL_collected_Recycled" to 0 for 1995 through 2020. For future projections, given that it is likely to require policy intervention to make recovery of these precious metals economically viable, this variable will stay set to 0 through 2050.

If copper is recovered by a PV recycler, it is typically sent to a specialized metal recycler as low quality scrap. The low quality copper scrap is recycled at a slightly lower efficiency than new scrap (98% as calculated above), therefore, we will assume 95% efficiency for EoL scrap. (S. Hernandez, L. Yusheng, and R. Labo, “World Copper Factbook 2017,” International Copper Study Group, 2017. Accessed: Jan. 13, 2021. [Online].

Most of applications of copper require high purity copper, and the copper industry is large and efficient at reusing scrap. Therefore, we are assuming that 100% of recycled copper goes into high quality material both from MFG scrap and EoL scrap. (“Innovations: Copper Water Tube: Good for Consumers, Good for the Environment.” https://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/1998/09/tube_recycle.html (accessed Jan. 21, 2021).). 
The amount of the HQ recycled copper which is reused for manufacturing both at MFG and EoL is set equal to the USGS market average of scrap content of consumed copper (“Annual Data 2017: Copper Supply & Consumption - 1996-2016,” Copper Development Association Inc., Copper Alliance, 2017. Accessed: Jan. 24, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://www.copper.org/resources/market_data/pdfs/annual_data.pdf., “Annual Data 2019, Copper Supply & Consumption - 1998-2018,” Copper Development Association Inc., Copper Alliance, 2019. Accessed: Jan. 24, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://www.copper.org/resources/market_data/pdfs/annual_data_2019.pdf.). The 1996 value is copied backwards for 1995, and the 2018 value is conservatively propogated forward for recycling scrap percentage (given that there is an upward trend for recycled content).
