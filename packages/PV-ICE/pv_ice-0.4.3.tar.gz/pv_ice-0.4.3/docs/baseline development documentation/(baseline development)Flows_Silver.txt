Silver Baseline Flows Assumptions

See the Jupyter Journal for the derivation of g/m^2 of module of silver.

The mining efficiency of silver, excluding overburden, is 80%, from 2002 data (T. Lanzano, M. Bertram, M. De Palo, C. Wagner, K. Zyla, and T. E. Graedel, “The contemporary European silver cycle,” Resources, Conservation and Recycling, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 27–43, Jan. 2006, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2005.06.003.). In the furnaces from various types of ores is approximately 95% recoverable (W. C. Butterman and H. E. Hilliard, “Silver,” USGS, Open-File Report 2004-1251, 2005. [Online]. Available: https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1251/.). A USGS 2009 Report indicates that 70% to 95% of silver is recoverable from various ore types (T. G. Goonan, “The Lifecycle of Silver in the United States in 2009,” USGS, Scientific Investigations Report Scientific Investigations Report 2013–5178, 2014. [Online]. Available: https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5178/.). Finally, silver is often recovered from copper ores. Therefore, We assume a 75% virgin material efficiency for silver.

We assume 80% manufacturing efficiency of silver, based on the overproduction of solar cells with silver on them (11% more cells than installed capacity) (C. Alexander et al., “World Silver Survey 2019,” The Silver Institute, Apr. 2019.), plus any additional processing inefficiencies, such as screen cleaning losses.

We assume that 95% of the silver scrapped in the manufacturing process is collected and sent to a recycler (accounting for non-recoverable processing inefficiencies). We assume that the recycling efficiency is the US industry average of 97% efficient for both MFG scrap and EoL scrap (H. E. Hilliard, “Silver Recycling in the United States in 2000,” U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY CIRCULAR 1196-N, 2000.) Because manufacturing scrap is considered higher quality than end use, we assume 100% of the collected MFG scrap is recycled to high quality. Finally, the MFG HQ recycled scrap is assumed to be used for PV applications at the same rate as the % of silver scrap in the world market (C. Alexander et al., “World Silver Survey 2019,” The Silver Institute, Apr. 2019., “WORLD SILVER SURVEY 2020,” The Silver Institute, WASHINGTON, D.C., Apr. 2020.). For years prior to 2009, the 2009 value was extended back, and for years after 2020, the % scrap value is extended forward. These scrap values are also used for EoL_HQ_reused for MFG.

Currently and historically, recycling of PV panels is minimal to non-existant. The current recycling process in the EU, done to comply with WEEE Directive, does not attempt to recover silver internal to the module. Given that this baseline represents the module encapsulated silver only, we will set "mat_EoL_collected_Recycled" to 0 for 1995 through 2020. For future projections, given that it is likely to require policy intervention to make recovery of these precious metals economically viable, this variable will stay set to 0 through 2050.

Based on silver scrap refining and silver end use demand (“WORLD SILVER SURVEY 2020,” The Silver Institute, WASHINGTON, D.C., Apr. 2020., H. E. Hilliard, “Silver Recycling in the United States in 2000,” U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY CIRCULAR 1196-N, 2000.), we assumed the EoL refined to HQ to be 80%. Silver scrap refining can be binned into low, 35-80%, and high purity >80%. Solder silver purity is above 75%, so recycling into manufacutring for PV would require a High quality silver recycling process. The price per oz for the different purities is up to 20% different. We are assuming that, despite the higher price for a high quality silver, some is not recoverable to the highest quality. It is assumed that the reycler companies that try to recover the silver focus on getting high quality purity 80% of silver.
