# This Journal documents the caculation of the mass of copper per module m^2. Currently this is based off busbar and ribbon data, LCI data points and does not necessarily include inverter or connection wiring (which can be classified as BOS).

# The ITRPVs indicate that more than 90% of the marketshare of modules uses copper ribbon instead of copper wire for stringing and tabbing cells together. We shall therefore assume all copper internal to the module is copper ribbon. A representative copper ribbon for PV from Ulbrich Solar Technologies is used as the standard for copper ribbon (“Standard PV Ribbon Datasheet.” Ulbrich Solar Technologies, Accessed: Jan. 14, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://www.pvribbon.com/wp-content/uploads/Datasheets/SPR_Datasheet.pdf). The <50 micron thickness of tin coating on the wire is neglected.

# We are working on a per module m^2 basis, therefore, we will assume that the ribbon lengths will be 1 meter, since they tend to stretch to the edges of the modules.

We will assume 3 busbars (made of 1 mm wide tabs) as the standard prior to ITRPV data (assumption supported by images of old modules). For the years where ITRPV lumps 3 and 4 busbar technology together, the percentage was split evenly between 3 and 4 busbars.
