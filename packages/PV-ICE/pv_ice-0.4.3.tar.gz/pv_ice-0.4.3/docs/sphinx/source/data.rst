Input Data for Mass Flows
--------------------------
At least two input files, such as the PV ICE baselines for crystalline silicon, are needed for the simulation: 

1. one file with module parameters throughout the years, for example *baseline_US*, and 
2. one or more files with process parameters for *each* material being analyzed in the module, for example *baseline_glass*. 

See **Module-Input-File** and **Material-Input-File** for more details on input columns needed and their definition. 

The baselines folder in the PV_ICE tool provides baseline scenarios for modules in the US and World level, as well as baseline_materials for 7 component materials of crystalline silicon PV modules. For more details on the source of these values, see the `Jupyter Journal documentation of baselines. <:ghuser:NREL/PV_ICE/tree/development/docs/tutorials/baseline%20development%20documentation>`_ These input files represent an average crystalline silicon module and its changing component materials over time. These files can be modified by the user to explore a particular technology(s). The necessary parameters (columns) for the module input file and the material input file are described below.

In addition to the above file inputs, there are a few parameters which are set at other times.

irradiance has a standard internal value of 1000.0 W/m^2. This value can be modified by ?!?!?!

The function ``calculateMassFlow`` can also take in weibullInputParams, bifacialityfactors, reducecapacity. WeibullInputParams can be use instead of T50 and T90 values. bifacialityfactors an be added to account for the contribution of bifacial modules. reducecapacity is used in combination with a modified irradience value to explore different locations.

Data: Energy
=============

The energy flows are based on the mass flows with units of energy per mass basis. As with the mass flows and to the best of our ability, the energy flows are sourced from real world values and literature, are dynamic to the annual level, and granular to specific processes. Below the variables are defined and their mass counterparts identified. For modules and each material, references used for creating the energy flow are listed as well.

Input Data for Energy Baselines
----------------------------------

baseline_energy_module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``year : int``
Year. 

``e_mod_MFG [kWh/m^2]: float``
The energy associated with the module level processes in manufacturing, including... Anything not captured in this energy is captured at the material level.

``e_mod_Install [kWh/m^2]: float``
The energy assiciated with transporting the completed module to the installation site, and energies required to prepare the site and mount the panel.

``e_mod_OandM [kWh/m^2]: float``
Energies associated with operation and maintenance of a PV site. This includes truck trips for maintenance, and any overnight energy required by the site. This can be set to 0 if desired.

``e_mod_Repair [kWh/m^2]: float``
Energy required to complete an in-field, on-site repair to a module. This includes truck trips, and cumulative embodied energy of standard replacement parts (ex: junction box, backsheet tape).

``e_mod_MerchantTail [kWh/m^2]: float``
For the reuse pathway "Merchant Tail", this implies the module is not removed from the site at EoL and continues to generate energy. The energy associated with this reuse pathway is 0, and this variable is to account for the "benefit" of reuse in place.

``e_mod_Demount [kWh/m^2]: float``
At EoL, modules must be removed from the site, regardless of their final disposition. This is the energy associated with demounting PV modules for EoL disposition. It includes truck trips and tooling needs.

``e_mod_Landfill [kWh/m^2]: float``
The energy associated with transporting the modules to the nearest landfill. Truck trips or potentially train container trips are included in this energy.

``e_mod_CollectedDisposition [kWh/m^2]: float``
For modules not sent straight to the landfill, they are considered "collected" in the mass flow to be actively dispositioned at EoL. This energy accounts for truck trips to a sorting facility, flash tester energy to power test unbroken modules, and any other sorting energies.

``e_mod_Resell [kWh/m^2]: float``
The reuse pathway "resell" implies reuse on the 2ndary market, where a module is removed from the field, tested, and deemed sufficiently functional (>250W or >125W/m^2 of a 2 m^2 module) for resale. Currently, used modules from the USA are being sold out of country. Therefore, this energy value includes energy for minor repairs or testing, cleaning and packaging, and international shipping via container ship.

``e_mod_Remanufacture [kWh/m^2]: float``
Modules which do not pass the collection/disposition flash test (<250W or <125/m^2 of a 2 m^2 module) OR are partially broken (ex: broken frame, cracked backsheet, bad junction box) may have the ability to recover still functional components, such as the glass or silicon cells, for direct reuse in manufacturing - i.e. remanufacture. This energy includes the energy associated with separating the targeted material from the rest of the module.

``e_mod_Recycled [kWh/m^2]: float``
Modules which are sent for recycling. This energy value includes module level recycling process energies, such as removing frames, crushing, grinding and physical separation of materials. Each material then has recycling energy associated with individual material recovery and refinement. 

baseline_energy_material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``e_mat_extraction [kWh/kg]: float``
Energies associated with mining and extracting the material to a base level market available product (ex: MG-Si, silver bars)

``e_mat_refinement [kWh/kg]: float``
Energies associated with turning the base level material product into the component or material composition used in PV manufacturing. This includes further purification steps as well as processing. These steps are particular to each material (ex: silicon from MG-Si to 9N Si, silver bar to silver paste). This includes the cumulative embodied energy of all non-tracked but process necessary materials, such as solvents, additives, in addition to all production steps required to generate the PV material product.

``e_mat_MFG [kWh/kg]: float``
Energies associated with the material specificstep of a PV manufacturing line. This includes the equipment energy as well as the cumulative embodied energy of process necessary materials such as solvents. (ex: screen printing silver, IPA/acetone cleaning solvents)

``e_mat_MFGScrap_Landfill [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with landfilling the manufacturing scrap material. This includes truck trip to the landfill.

``e_mat_MFGScrap_LQ [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with recycling the MFG scrap to a low quality. This is the lowest energy level of recycling for a material. This includes all material specific processing and refining to return it to base level market available product.

``e_mat_MFGScrap_HQ [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with the refinement steps necessary to take the base level market product to a higher purity/quality such that it could be reused for PV Manufacturing or in a comparable alternate use (ex: computer chips). This energy is additive to e_mat_MFGScrap_LQ. 

``e_mat_MFGScrap_HQ4MFG [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with making the refined material into the PV specific material for PV Manufacturing. This energy is additive to e_mat_MFGScrap_LQ and e_mat_MFGScrap_HQ. ***SHOULD THIS BE DIFFERENT THAN HQ?***

``e_mat_EoL_Remanufacture [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with cleaning and prepping the material targeted for remanufacture such that it can be directly reused in MFG.

``e_mat_RecycleScrap_Landfilled [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with landfilling the inefficiencies from the material recycling process. This inlcudes truck trip to the landfill.

``e_mat_Recycled_LQ [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy required to recycle the EoL material to a base level market available product. This includes process energy as well as cumulative embodied energy of process necessary non-tracked materials like solvents.

``e_mat_Recycled_HQ [kWh/kg]:float``
The energy associated with the refinement steps necessary to take the base level market product to a higher purity/quality such that it could be reused for PV Manufacturing or in a comparable alternate use (ex: computer chips). This energy is additive to e_mat_Recycled_LQ. 

``e_mat_Recycled_HQ4MFG [kWh/kg]: float``
The energy associated with making the refined material into the PV specific material for PV Manufacturing. This energy is additive to e_mat_Recycled_LQ and e_mat_Recycled_HQ.
