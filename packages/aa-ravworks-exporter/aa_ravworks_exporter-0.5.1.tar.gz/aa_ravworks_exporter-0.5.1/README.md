# AllianceAuth Ravworks Exporter

This is a plugin for [AllianceAuth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth) that exports ESI data to a config file for [Ravworks](https://ravworks.com/).

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires a working AllianceAuth installation with v3 as a minimum version. See the [AllianceAuth installation instructions](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html) for more information.

Data from ESI are not directly fetched by this application, instead it relies on other AllianceAuth plugins. Currently the following plugins are supported:

Skills:

- [MemberAudit](https://apps.allianceauth.org/apps/detail/aa-memberaudit)
- [CorpTools](https://apps.allianceauth.org/apps/detail/allianceauth-corptools)

Structures:

- [aa-structures](https://apps.allianceauth.org/apps/detail/aa-structures)
- [CorpTools](https://apps.allianceauth.org/apps/detail/allianceauth-corptools)

If there are multiple plugins for the same functionality, only 1 is needed. If no plugin is installed, that functionality will be unavailable.

    ```bash
    pip install aa-ravworks-exporter
    ```
