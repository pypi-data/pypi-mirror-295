| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `account`     | Define the account of this bank statement                                                                                                                 |
| `currency`    | The base currency of the account                                                                                                                          |

2.0.3
-----
- Use ATM types for ATM events, XFER type for EXCHANGE operations, and add FEE type (thanks @3v1n0)
- Handle empty balance fields (thanks @3v1n0)

2.0.2
-----
- Ignore other than COMPLETED transactions. Pending transactions have their own structure in OFX
  called STMTTRNP, but ofxstatement doesn't support it.
- Include the "Started Date" as the date the user initiated the transaction.

2.0.1
-----
- Version 2.0.0 republished due to some issues with PyPI

2.0.0
-----

- Complete backwards-incompatible refactoring, support the new CSV format
- Requires ofxstatement >= 0.7.2
- Any transactions with a fee will generate an additional fee transaction where the payee is "Revolut"

1.6.0
-----

- Since version 0.6.5 ofxstatement requires a statement line to have either id, refnum or check_no. To avoid failing
  the conversion, there's now a unique MD5 hashed ID computed from the date, payee, amount and balance.

1.5.0
-----

- Improved the parser by making the column header verification less strict.

1.4.0
-----

- Support September 2019 iOS CSV format

1.3.0
-----

- Date format is now configurable in the settings
- "Payment from " is now also counted as a deposit

1.2.0
-----

- Support May 2018 CSV format

1.1.0
-----

- Support April 2018 CSV format

1.0.0
-----

- First release
