> Disclaimer: We evaluate how accurately ML models predict solid-state thermodynamic stability. Although this is an important aspect of high-throughput materials discovery, the ranking cannot give a complete picture of a model's general applicability to materials. A high ranking does not constitute endorsement by the Materials Project.

Matbench Discovery is an [interactive leaderboard](https://janosh.github.io/matbench-discovery/models) and associated [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/matbench-discovery) which together make it easy to rank ML energy models on a task designed to simulate high-throughput discovery of new stable inorganic crystals.

We've tested <slot name="model-count" />models covering multiple methodologies including graph neural network (GNN) interatomic potentials, GNN one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian optimizers and random forests with shallow-learning structure fingerprints.

<slot name="best-report" />

Our results show that ML models have become robust enough to deploy them as triaging steps to more effectively allocate compute in high-throughput DFT relaxations. This work provides valuable insights for anyone looking to build large-scale materials databases.
