About
=====


**W**\ eb **T**\ ime **S**\ eries **S**\ ervice (WTSS) is a lightweight web service for handling time series data from remote sensing imagery. Given a location and a time interval you can retrieve the according time series as a list of real values.


In WTSS a coverage is a three dimensional array associate to spatial and temporal reference systems.

    :alt: Coverage as a three dimensional array


WTSS is based on three operations:

- ``list_coverages``: returns the list of all available coverages in the service.

- ``describe_coverage``: returns the metadata of a given coverage.

- ``time_series``: query the database for the list of values for a given location and time interval.


If you want to know more about WTSS service, please, take a look at its `specification <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/wtss-spec>`_.


Installation
============


Linux, macOS, and Windows users can get ``wtss`` from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/wtss/>`_ with a recent version of ``pip``::

    pip install wtss


.. note::

    If you want to install the Matplotlib support, use the following command::

        pip install wtss[matplotlib]


Documentation
=============


See https://wtss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
