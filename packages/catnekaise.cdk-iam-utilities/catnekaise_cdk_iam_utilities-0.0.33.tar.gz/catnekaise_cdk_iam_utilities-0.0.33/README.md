# CDK IAM Utilities

Example implementation of this library exist in [catnekaise/actions-constructs](https://github.com/catnekaise/actions-constructs).

## Developer Notes

The general idea is that the utilities in this library can serve as building blocks for composing other utilities that ideally should aid the existing aws-iam library in certain situations.
