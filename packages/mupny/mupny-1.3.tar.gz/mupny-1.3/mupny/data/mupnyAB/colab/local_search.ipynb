However, the individuals with a higher value score are more likely to be selected. We perform these operations in the _select_ function. This function returns two individuals from the population;\n",
        "2. **crossover**: given the two selected individuals, we combine randomly them. Combining them randomly means that we merge their sequence of characters taking the first part of the sequence from the first individual, the second one from the second individual. The split index is generated randomly. We perform these operations in the _crossover_ function. This function returns an offspring (i.e., a state).\n",
        "3. **mutation**: given the offspring from the crossover operations, we modify a gene of the offspring if a random probability is greater than a certain treshold. A gene is a character of the sequence that represents the state. Of course, the randomly modified gene must have an accepted value from the gene pool. The gene pool is the set of characters that a gene can assume. For instance, in the 8-queens problem, the accepted values is in the range 0,7 given the 8x8 chess board. Both the gene to modify and the value that it is going to assume are generated randomly.\n",
