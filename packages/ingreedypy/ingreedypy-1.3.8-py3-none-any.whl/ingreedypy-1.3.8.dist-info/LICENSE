This license applies to the ingreedy-py Python library.  To address some
potential for ambiguity: the ingreedy-py library began as a computer language
translation ('port') of the similarly-named 'ingreedy-js' JavaScript library
by Ian C. Anderson (https://github.com/iancanderson/ingreedy-js) with commit
history dating back to 2014.
