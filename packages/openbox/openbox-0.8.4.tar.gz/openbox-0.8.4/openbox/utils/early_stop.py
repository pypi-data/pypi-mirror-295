    Class for early stop algorithms.

    Criteria for early stop include:
    1. No Improvement Rounds: Stop if the optimization does not improve over a number of rounds.
    2. Improvement Threshold: Stop if the Expected Improvement is less than a certain percentage of
       the difference between the best objective value and the default objective value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_iter : int
        Minimum number of iterations before early stop is considered.
    min_improvement_percentage : float
        The minimum improvement percentage. If the Expected Improvement (EI) is less than
        `min_improvement_percentage * (default_obj_value - best_obj_value)`, early stop is triggered.
        If `improvement_threshold` is 0, this criterion is disabled.
    max_no_improvement_rounds : int
        The maximum tolerable rounds with no improvement before early stop.
        If `max_no_improvement_rounds` is 0, this criterion is disabled.
