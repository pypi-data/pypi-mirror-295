  The 0.7.3 release fixes the circuit cutting code to be compatible
  with the forthcoming Qiskit 1.2 release.  It also pins numpy to
  version 1.X, as DOCplex (which is used by the legacy CutQC
  implementation) is incompatible with numpy 2.0.

    The circuit cutting module now uses a stringified UUID instead of
    a ``UUID`` object when it needs to generate a unique label for
    circuit barriers during processing, as the forthcoming Qiskit 1.2
    release requires that labels always be a string.
