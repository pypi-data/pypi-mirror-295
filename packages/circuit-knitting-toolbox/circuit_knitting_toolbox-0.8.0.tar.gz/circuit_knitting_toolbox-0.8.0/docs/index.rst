Circuit Knitting is the process of decomposing a quantum circuit into smaller circuits, executing those smaller circuits on a quantum processor(s), and then knitting their results into a reconstruction of the original circuit's outcome.

The toolbox currently contains the following tools:

- Circuit Cutting

For a more detailed discussion on circuit cutting, check out our `technical guide <./circuit_cutting/explanation/index.rst#overview-of-circuit-cutting>`__.

This project is meant to evolve rapidly and, as such, does not follow `Qiskit's deprecation policy <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md>`__.  We may occasionally make breaking changes in order to improve the user experience.  When possible, we will keep old interfaces and mark them as deprecated, as long as they can co-exist with the new ones.  Each substantial improvement, breaking change, or deprecation will be documented in the :ref:`release notes`.

Citing this project
-------------------

If you use the Circuit Knitting Toolbox in your research, please cite it according to ``CITATON.bib`` file included in this repository:

.. literalinclude:: ../CITATION.bib
   :language: bibtex

If you are using the entanglement forging tool in CKT version 0.5 or earlier, please use `an older version of the citation file <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/blob/stable/0.5/CITATION.bib>`__ which includes the authors of that tool.

If you are using the CutQC tool in CKT version 0.7 or earlier, please use `an older version of the citation file <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/blob/stable/0.7/CITATION.bib>`__ which includes the authors of that tool.
