Overview
--------

The ``howe`` project contains the ``Howe`` class. A ``Howe`` object is similar to a ``zip`` object, except that all the iterators have to run out at the same time. Otherwise an ``ExceptionGroup`` (containing the ``StopIteration`` exceptions from the iterators that did run out) will be raised. The project is named for E. Howe, one of the intentors of the zipper.

Installation
------------

To install ``howe``, you can use ``pip``. Open your terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install howe
