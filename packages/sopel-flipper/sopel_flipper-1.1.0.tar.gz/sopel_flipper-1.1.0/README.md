# sopel-flipper

A Sopel plugin that flips text in response to CTCP ACTIONs.

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-flipper
```

## Using

Flip or roll text with a CTCP ACTION (`/me` command) and Sopel will output the
transformed text along with an appropriate _kaomoji_.

Try `/me flips a table` or `/me rolls xnaas down a hill` for Easter eggs.
