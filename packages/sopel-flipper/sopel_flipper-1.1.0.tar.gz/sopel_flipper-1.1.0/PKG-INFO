# sopel-flipper

A Sopel plugin that flips text in response to CTCP ACTIONs.

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-flipper
```

## Using

Flip or roll text with a CTCP ACTION (`/me` command) and Sopel will output the
transformed text along with an appropriate _kaomoji_.

Try `/me flips a table` or `/me rolls xnaas down a hill` for Easter eggs.

## Changelog

### 1.1.0

Added:
* Horizontal `.mirror` command feature (#10)


### 1.0.0

Reworked for the Python-3-only world.

Added:
* Regular prefix-based commands for `.flip` and `.roll` (#9)

Changed:
* Rolling always uses the "down a hill" format that was previously an Easter
  egg, to differentiate it more from flipping (#8)

Meta:
* Package metadata modernized using `pyproject.toml` (#8)
* Refactored a big chunk of the plugin code (#8)
* Python older than 3.8 is no longer officially supported (#8)
  * Sopel 7.1 bots are still supported, if running on Python >=3.8
* Releases are now automated (#8)


### 0.1.0

Initial release.

Changed:
* Converted from single file to entry-point package
* Properly specified dependencies
* Upgraded to Sopel 7.1+ coding standards
