# dg_zoo_server - DeGirum Model Zoo Server

Model zoo server, which is API-compatible with [DeGirum DeLight Cloud Platform](https://cs.degirum.com) 
and can be used instead of it in PySDK.

## Installation and Startup

`dg_zoo_server` is distributed as Python package and can be installed by running 
`pip install dg_zoo_server`

Once installed, you can run it by executing `dg_zoo_server` command from the terminal,
assuming your prepared your local model zoo directory which your `dg_zoo_server` 
instance will serve according to rules [described below](#model-zoo-directory-structure).

Command-line parameters (all of them are optional):

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
|`--port PORT` | Port number to run the server on | `8878` |
|`--zoo ZOO`   | Model zoo root directory to serve (see details [below](#model-zoo-directory-structure))| `./zoo` |
|`--reload`    | Auto-reload server sources on change | disabled |

If you prefer to run the server programmatically from the Python code, you can do it this way
(command line arguments are given as an example):

```Python
import dg_zoo_server

dg_zoo_server.serverStart("--port 80 --zoo ./myzoo")
```

## Model Zoo Directory Structure

The model zoo root directory, which you pass as `--zoo` command line argument,
has the following structure:

- `tokens.json` file located just in the model zoo root directory, containing
token information (this file is optional; more on that [below](#token-file-structure));

- first-level subdirectories of zoo root directory represent *organizations* - entities,
which can have multiple model zoos;

    *Note: The notion of organization is inherited from
    DeGirum DeLight cloud platform, where they correspond to real organizations.
    In the case of local zoo server the notion of organization is left for API compatibility
    reasons: it is mere a way or logically grouping multiple model zoos and has nothing to 
    do with permissions.*

- second-level subdirectories (subdirectories in the organization directories) represent 
individual *model zoos* - collections of AI models;

- each model zoo subdirectory may contain a list of model .zip archives. Each such
.zip archive represents one model. 

For example:

```
myzoo/
    tokens.json
    degirum/
        public/
            model1.zip
            model2.zip
        private/
            model3.zip
            model4.zip
```

The model archive must adhere to the following rules:

- it must have a name which matches the model name;

- the archive must contain the top-level directory named as the model name;

- inside that top-level directory in the archive, there must be the following 
model files:

    - model parameters JSON file, named as the model name;
    - model binary file, named as the model name; its extension is
    model-specific and depends on the model inference runtime;

- additionally, there can be the following optional files:

    - label dictionary JSON file, referenced from the model parameters JSON file;
    - model README.MD markdown text file, containing model description.

For example:

```
yolo_v5s_coco--512x512_quant_n2x_orca1_1.zip:
    yolo_v5s_coco--512x512_quant_n2x_orca1_1\
        yolo_v5s_coco--512x512_quant_n2x_orca1_1.json
        yolo_v5s_coco--512x512_quant_n2x_orca1_1.n2x
        labels_coco_80.json
        README.md
```

## Token File Structure

The `tokens.json` file, which is located just in the model zoo root directory,
contains the information about access tokens, which are used to give granular
access to model zoos served by Model Zoo Server.

Such tokens can be used in PySDK instead of Cloud API access tokens, when 
you work with locally served model zoos. More on that [below](#working-with-model-zoo-server).

Tokens are passed in the HTTP header to all [REST API](#rest-api) routes to protect
those routes from unauthorized use. 

Tokens are divided into two categories: admin tokens and regular tokens:

- admin tokens give access to all [REST API](#rest-api) routes and to all model zoos
for both read and write access;

- regular tokens give only read access only to [model zoo API](#zoo-management-api)
and only to model zoos, which a particular regular token has access to.

The structure of the token JSON file is the following:

```
{
  "<token1>": {
    "is_admin": <true/false>,
    "zoos": ["<org1>/<zoo1>", ...]
  },
  ...
}
```

Top-level dictionary contains token entries, keyed by token value.
Each token entry is an object with two keys:

- `"is_admin"` is a boolean value which is `true` for tokens with admin rights, 
and `false` otherwise;

- `"zoos"` is a list of model zoo names, this token has access to.
Each model zoo is represented as a string containing organization name and zoo name, 
separated with a slash, for example `"org1/zoo1"`. 

The `tokens.json` file is optional - you may start Model Zoo Server without that file.
In this case there will be no tokens defined, and all Model Zoo Server routes will
fail with `401 Unauthorized` error except the only route `POST /zoo/v1/public/tokens`,
which will generate initial admin token without any tokens passed in the header.
Once that initial admin token is generated, it will not be possible to call that route 
without a token again.

To deploy tokens you have two choices:

1. Prepare proper `tokens.json` file yourself in advance.
2. Use [token management API](#token-management-api) to generate tokens in runtime.


## Working with Model Zoo Server

Imagine you run Model Zoo Server on some node in your LAN with some IP address, 
for example `192.168.1.123`, and want to work with this local zoo server instead of
DeGirum cloud zoo server. Imagine you started your Model Zoo Server to serve
a model zoo, which contains organization directory `org1` and zoo subdirectory `zoo1` 
inside that organization directory.

Then, if you want to inference models from that zoo, you can do it the following way:

```
import degirum as dg
zoo = dg.connect(dg.LOCAL, "http://192.168.1.123/org1/zoo1", token="<token>")
print(zoo.list_models())
```

Here you specify zoo URL in a form `http://<hostname>/<org>/<zoo>` where 
`<hostname>` is the name of the host if your LAN running Model Zoo Server, 
`<org>` is the name of the organization directory, and `<zoo>` is the name
of zoo subdirectory.

You also specify `<token>`, which has permissions to work with that zoo.

You can connect to both local inference engine and to AI server inference engine.

To work with local inference engine you pass `dg.LOCAL` parameter to the 
`dg.connect()` call. In this case the inference engine will run directly in
the current process on your host. Your host must have access to Model Zoo Server
host in order to download models.

To work with AI server inference engine, you first start AI server on some host 
in your LAN - it can be the same host, which runs Model Zoo Server, or it can be
different host. Then your pass the hostname/IP address of the AI server host to
the `dg.connect()` call. In this case, the AI server host must have access to
the Model Zoo Server host in order to download models.

## REST API

REST API of the running instance of Model Zoo Server can be obtained by 
opening `/docs` URL path of that running instance in your browser. 

OpenAPI JSON schema of Model Zoo Server REST API is available by `/openapi.json` URL path.

The following sections only list all available REST API routes. The detailed information about
parameters and responses can be obtained by opening `/docs` URL path.
