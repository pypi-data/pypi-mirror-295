# Project Arrakeen

This is an umbrella project providing a framework for portable PDKs and scalable digital and analog building blocks.  
The setup of this project is currently in exploration phase to find out right setup to aid development, dependency management, user friendliness etc. Consequence is that releases are done as alpha releases for the moment without proper documentation or release notes. Commit messages to the project need to be used for the moment to get a grasp of what is going on development-wise.
