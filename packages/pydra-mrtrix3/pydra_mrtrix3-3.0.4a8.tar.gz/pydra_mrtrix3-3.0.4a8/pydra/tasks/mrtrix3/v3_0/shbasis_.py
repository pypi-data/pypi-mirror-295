    """In previous versions of MRtrix, the convention used for storing spherical harmonic coefficients was a non-orthonormal basis (the m!=0 coefficients were a factor of sqrt(2) too large). This error has been rectified in newer versions of MRtrix, but will cause issues if processing SH data that was generated using an older version of MRtrix (or vice-versa).

        This command provides a mechanism for testing the basis used in storage of image data representing a spherical harmonic series per voxel, and allows the user to forcibly modify the raw image data to conform to the desired basis.

        Note that the "force_*" conversion choices should only be used in cases where this command has previously been unable to automatically determine the SH basis from the image data, but the user themselves are confident of the SH basis of the data.

        The spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according to the conventions described in the main documentation, which can be found at the following link:
