        "1. Action Item: Items that can be used one time, providing temporary benefits, effects, or simply filling a spot in the inventory.\n"
        "These may be consumed upon use or have limited duration. They might offer direct advantages, trigger events, or serve as collectibles.\n"

        "These items can be equipped in various slots (e.g., head, chest, weapon).\n"
        "3. Stat-Boosting Equipment: Equipment that offers permanent stat bonuses or other lasting benefits while equipped.\n\n"
        "Once you have classified the items, your next task is to determine the most appropriate objective type for each item based on the player's interaction with it. Choose from the following two options:\n"
        "1. Pickup Item: The item must be collected or acquired by the player, typically to be added to their inventory or used later in the quest.\n"
