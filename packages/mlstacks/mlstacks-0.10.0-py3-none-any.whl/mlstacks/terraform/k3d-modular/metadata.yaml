  A recipe that creates a k3d cluster with a local registry,
  and optionally deploys a Kubeflow and/or Tekton orchestrator on top of it, a
  minio storage as an artifact store, MLfow as an experiment tracker and Seldon
  and/or KServe as a model server.

Cloud: k3d

Prerequisites: |
  * Docker must be installed on your local machine.
  * Install k3d by running `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash`.
