deprecations:
  - |
    The :func:`.execute_experiments` function has been deprecated.
    Going forward, users should first call
    :func:`.generate_cutting_experiments` to generate the
    subexperiment circuits and then submit these circuits directly to
    the desired Sampler(s).  The :ref:`tutorials <circuit cutting
    tutorials>` have been updated with this new workflow.
