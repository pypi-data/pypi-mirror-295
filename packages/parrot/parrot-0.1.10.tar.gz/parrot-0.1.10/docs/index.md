# Getting started with parrot

*parrot* is designed to process continuously recorded THz traces from a THz-TDS.
parrot can process the raw, continuous measurement data (consisting of time, position of the delay stage, and the THz
signal) and retrieves an averaged, high quality THz trace with access to interpolated individual traces as well as
further
statistics.

See the jupyter notebook `example.ipynb`, `example_compact.ipynb`, and python file `example.py` in the root directory,
which show step-by-step how parrot can be used.

To achieve this goal, parrot is divided into three main modules:

1. [Load](./load.md)

2. [Process](./process.md)

3. [Plot](./plot.md)

You can also find the corresponding documentation for each module also in the header above.

The program is written by Tim Vogel at the Photonics and Ultrafast Laser Science (PULS) group at the Ruhr-University
Bochum, Germany and released as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

## Virtual environment for forking/debugging of parrot

*The following steps are meant for development purposes of parrot and should not be necessary to run parrot.*

The Anaconda environment is stored in `enivronment.yml`, which is automatically created by
running `conda env export --from-history > environment.yml`.
Unfortunately, there is currently a bug in Python's virtual-environment `venv` which, due to a cmake error, fails to
install the classic `requirement.txtÂ´ and thus the use of an Anaconda environment. To manually fork the code
and create a corresponding virtual environment, simply run the following commands in the root directory of the
downloaded source files:

```
conda create --name parrot --file .\environment.yml
conda activate parrot
python .\Example_compact.py
```
